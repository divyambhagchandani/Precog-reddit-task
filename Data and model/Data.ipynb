       "  'post': '    A.R.K — Acts of Random Kindness\\n\\n---\\n\\n* 📖 Giveaway [Part 5]\\n\\nAfter launching four successful book giveaways — [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/), [third] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7vzda/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_both_the/), [fourth] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/az1i04/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_crime_and/) — and getting tremendous responses by everyone, I decided to do this more often. Although I am planning to make this a monthly thing, it\\'d require some time to set it up. I\\'ll\\'ve to arrange proper system and channels to ease the process, and have more transparency and automation. I am already on it! 😃\\n\\n---\\n\\n**UPDATE #1** Congratulations everyone! The book is now one of the top in Amazon\\'s \\'Best Sellers\\' and \\'Most Wished For\\' Lists 😃\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor this giveaway, I selected the book which was much requested since our first Giveaway:\\n\\n**Brave New World by Aldous Huxley**\\n\\nOn BNW: 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451 are widely celebrated as the trilogy of authoritarian warning. They are also the most banned books. When you put it in historical context and realize that Huxley\\'s magnum opus was published in 1932 - when Fascism was on the rise in Europe and just before World War II started -  before many of the ideas that Huxley explores were even developed as they are today, it makes it even more of an astounding read. It\\'s a bit disturbing how accurate a book written in the 1930\\'s has been. Also, I think it can be paired with Mill\\'s Utilitarianism to get a good idea.\\n\\nIt takes place in an advanced future where humans are cloned, socially indoctrinated and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian order. It is a remarkable piece of literature in that it deals with a world that is genetically engineered and could become a reality. \\nWhat makes this novel so powerful; it’s not unbelievable. There’s just enough truth within Brave New World for it to be real. It’s a cruel mirroring of our own existence, should we follow a certain path too strongly. \\nNationalism, Jingoism, Xenophobia, Fascism, Authoritarianism, Totalitarianism, Separatism, Isolationism...how subtly they are intertwined, with much accountability.\\n\\nQuotes from the book:\\n> “Because our world is not the same as Othello’s world. You can’t make flivvers without steel and you can’t make tragedies without social instability. The world’s stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can’t get. They’re well off; they’re safe; they’re never ill; they’re not afraid of death; they’re blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they’re plagued with no mothers or fathers; they’ve got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they’re so conditioned that they practically can’t help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong, there’s soma. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn’t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.” \\n\\n> “But I don\\'t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.” \\n\\n> “I ate civilization. It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,\" he added in a lower tone, \"I ate my own wickedness.” \\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you are interested in reading this, here\\'s how you can get it!\\n\\nI send the books through *Gift Registries*. This way you don\\'t have to disclose your personal details and address to me. Gift registries are safe, from privacy point of view.

Okay, I am bad at asking for help, but I\\'ve never done anything like this before. Some people suggested me to open a donation box for this.

A.R.K — Acts of Random Kindness\\n\\n---\\n\\n* 📖 Giveaway [Part 5]\\n\\nAfter launching four successful book giveaways — [first](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/), [second](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/), [third] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a7vzda/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_both_the/), [fourth] (https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/az1i04/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_crime_and/) — and getting tremendous responses by everyone, I decided to do this more often. Although I am planning to make this a monthly thing, it\\'d require some time to set it up. I\\'ll\\'ve to arrange proper system and channels to ease the process, and have more transparency and automation. I am already on it! 😃\\n\\n---\\n\\n**UPDATE #1** Congratulations everyone! The book is now one of the top in Amazon\\'s \\'Best Sellers\\' and \\'Most Wished For\\' Lists 😃\\n\\n---\\n\\nFor this giveaway, I selected the book which was much requested since our first Giveaway:\\n\\n**Brave New World by Aldous Huxley**\\n\\nOn BNW: 1984, Brave New World, and Fahrenheit 451 are widely celebrated as the trilogy of authoritarian warning. They are also the most banned books. When you put it in historical context and realize that Huxley\\'s magnum opus was published in 1932 - when Fascism was on the rise in Europe and just before World War II started -  before many of the ideas that Huxley explores were even developed as they are today, it makes it even more of an astounding read. It\\'s a bit disturbing how accurate a book written in the 1930\\'s has been. Also, I think it can be paired with Mill\\'s Utilitarianism to get a good idea.\\n\\nIt takes place in an advanced future where humans are cloned, socially indoctrinated and pharmaceutically anesthetized to passively uphold an authoritarian order. It is a remarkable piece of literature in that it deals with a world that is genetically engineered and could become a reality. \\nWhat makes this novel so powerful; it’s not unbelievable. There’s just enough truth within Brave New World for it to be real. It’s a cruel mirroring of our own existence, should we follow a certain path too strongly. \\nNationalism, Jingoism, Xenophobia, Fascism, Authoritarianism, Totalitarianism, Separatism, Isolationism...how subtly they are intertwined, with much accountability.\\n\\nQuotes from the book:\\n> “Because our world is not the same as Othello’s world. You can’t make flivvers without steel and you can’t make tragedies without social instability. The world’s stable now. People are happy; they get what they want, and they never want what they can’t get. They’re well off; they’re safe; they’re never ill; they’re not afraid of death; they’re blissfully ignorant of passion and old age; they’re plagued with no mothers or fathers; they’ve got no wives, or children, or lovers to feel strongly about; they’re so conditioned that they practically can’t help behaving as they ought to behave. And if anything should go wrong, there’s soma. Actual happiness always looks pretty squalid in comparison with the over-compensations for misery. And, of course, stability isn’t nearly so spectacular as instability. And being contented has none of the glamour of a good fight against misfortune, none of the picturesqueness of a struggle with temptation, or a fatal overthrow by passion or doubt. Happiness is never grand.” \\n\\n> “But I don\\'t want comfort. I want God, I want poetry, I want real danger, I want freedom, I want goodness. I want sin.” \\n\\n> “I ate civilization. It poisoned me; I was defiled. And then,\" he added in a lower tone, \"I ate my own wickedness.” \\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you are interested in reading this, here\\'s how you can get it!\\n\\nI send the books through *Gift Registries*. This way you don\\'t have to disclose your personal details and address to me. Gift registries are safe, from privacy point of view. I won\\'t be able to see any Addresses/Mobile or anything, completely confidential.\\nIf you don\\'t know how Gift Registries work, don\\'t worry, here\\'s how you can set it up in 5 minutes:\\n> Log in to you Amazon.in account.\\n\\n> Go to \\'Your Account\\' > \\'Your Addresses\\' > Click on Add Address > Save your full address including your mobile number > Save > Click on \\'Set as Default\\' to make that address your default [This is important]\\n\\n> Now Create a WishList, it should be Public and not Shared. Remember to check the box that says \\'Third Party Shipping Agreement\\', when you make the list.\\n\\n> Now search for the title of the book, and add the book to the same Public WishList.\\n\\n> And you\\'re done!\\n\\nAfter you\\'re done with setting up your Gift Registry:\\n\\n* You first need to request for the book by commenting on this post, so to get visibility, and I can add you to my list from there. This way I get to manage list of requests in a sequence.\\n* Now you need to DM me your WishList link.

       "  'post': 'Around the age of nine, I believed my father was the richest man in town for he would say things like, \"I smoke more cigarettes than what you make in a month \". That is a really obnoxious thing to say to somebody but as a nine year old I thought that\\'s what rich people say and the neighborhood where I grew up in which is a little town in the Northeast, is full of gamblers, and unfortunately, my father was one.\\n\\nMy father worked in the department of agriculture but couldn\\'t save none. When I was around 14 years old, my father sold our house for only five lakh rupees, my mother battled everyday, reached out to people to convince him not to but nobody helped and I didn\\'t understand anything about it, neither did my elder sister who was 17 at the time.\\n\\nHe never encouraged us to study and the neighborhood didn\\'t inspire it either and consequently we hardly cleared our matriculation. After that, no college for us.\\n\\nIt was around 2012 when I got my first cell phone which was a Chinese phone with a 2g network (took 40 mins or something to download a 4mb song), with that phone, I taught myself everything I know, I can safely say I learned from that phone more than what I learned in school. \\n\\nI started confronting my father when I turned 17 or something about what he did to us and he always said things like, \"I don\\'t earn for you, I earn for myself\", \"when I die, you\\'ll get enough money from the government to build a house and live happily\".\\n\\nWhich wasn\\'t true. My father died back in 2017 and now we\\'re told to leave the quarter. They let us live for two years but not anymore.\\n\\nI was never forced to go out and work and with a 10 pass certificate, I\\'m not going to find any work either. Shit has hit the fan. We got some 15 lakh from the office and paid 2.5 lakh for some loan he had, now with that little budget we can\\'t imagine building a house in this age, plus my sister is unmarried.\\n\\nI love my mother so much, I loved my father as well despite what kind of a person he was, he was my father nevertheless. But my mother, she\\'s my life. If it wasn\\'t for my mother, i would\\'ve ended this life.\\n\\nMy relatives stopped calling us a year later my father\\'s death lest we ask them for help.\\n\\nIt\\'s just 3 of us now, nobody comes to our house anymore, my father\\'s work colleagues who used to treat me like a son now passes me by like I\\'m some stranger.\\n\\nLife is bleak with no hope in sight. I\\'m soon to be 24 with no prior experience in work. I\\'ve been told to move out of the town but i can\\'t imagine living my mother and sister in a place where there\\'s no one to take care of them.\\n\\nI dream about 3 of us killing ourselves. I hope it doesn\\'t come to pass.\\n\\nMy father never let me work, not even go to market and get groceries because he thought I\\'m a fool, i can\\'t use money. I squandered my life away.

       "  'all': 'I\\'m a male[23] need advice.. Around the age of nine, I believed my father was the richest man in town for he would say things like, \"I smoke more cigarettes than what you make in a month \". That is a really obnoxious thing to say to somebody but as a nine year old I thought that\\'s what rich people say and the neighborhood where I grew up in which is a little town in the Northeast, is full of gamblers, and unfortunately, my father was one.\\n\\nMy father worked in the department of agriculture but couldn\\'t save none. When I was around 14 years old, my father sold our house for only five lakh rupees, my mother battled everyday, reached out to people to convince him not to but nobody helped and I didn\\'t understand anything about it, neither did my elder sister who was 17 at the time.\\n\\nHe never encouraged us to study and the neighborhood didn\\'t inspire it either and consequently we hardly cleared our matriculation. After that, no college for us.\\n\\nIt was around 2012 when I got my first cell phone which was a Chinese phone with a 2g network (took 40 mins or something to download a 4mb song), with that phone, I taught myself everything I know, I can safely say I learned from that phone more than what I learned in school. \\n\\nI started confronting my father when I turned 17 or something about what he did to us and he always said things like, \"I don\\'t earn for you, I earn for myself\", \"when I die, you\\'ll get enough money from the government to build a house and live happily\".\\n\\nWhich wasn\\'t true. My father died back in 2017 and now we\\'re told to leave the quarter. They let us live for two years but not anymore.\\n\\nI was never forced to go out and work and with a 10 pass certificate, I\\'m not going to find any work either. Shit has hit the fan. We got some 15 lakh from the office and paid 2.5 lakh for some loan he had, now with that little budget we can\\'t imagine building a house in this age, plus my sister is unmarried.\\n\\nI love my mother so much, I loved my father as well despite what kind of a person he was, he was my father nevertheless. But my mother, she\\'s my life. If it wasn\\'t for my mother, i would\\'ve ended this life.\\n\\nMy relatives stopped calling us a year later my father\\'s death lest we ask them for help.\\n\\nIt\\'s just 3 of us now, nobody comes to our house anymore, my father\\'s work colleagues who used to treat me like a son now passes me by like I\\'m some stranger.\\n\\nLife is bleak with no hope in sight. I\\'m soon to be 24 with no prior experience in work. I\\'ve been told to move out of the town but i can\\'t imagine living my mother and sister in a place where there\\'s no one to take care of them.\\n\\nI dream about 3 of us killing ourselves. I hope it doesn\\'t come to pass.\\n\\nMy father never let me work, not even go to market and get groceries because he thought I\\'m a fool, i can\\'t use money. I squandered my life away. I work in our locality but it\\'s not work in the traditional sense, i just help out people for little to no money.\\n\\nWhat can I do? I don\\'t hope to make my mother proud, I just want a stable life and always be there for my mother.\\n\\nMy nearest city is Guwahati. There I might my some work but again, can\\'t leave them here and I a city like Guwahati, where average rent is 10k+, all of us can\\'t move there either.\\n\\nHow do I make thing work, how do I make myself work?\\n\\nHow do you go out and find work? I have no real world experience. I used to have a really good friend, thought he was my best friend but that\\'s not true. He stopped hanging out with me.\\n\\nI play ludo with my mother and sister to keep them distracted of our imminent dark days.\\n\\nHelp me..'},\n",

In fact, the total recommended reserve prices of INR 536,239 crore (over US$80 billion) for the spectrum bands in the auction are almost double the cost of all spectrum investment to date in India.

I have met two guys till now.\\n\\nThe first guy, all he was interested in was partying. He refused to talk about anything else other than the various ways he has partied. I'll be honest here. I haven't partied as much. I come from quite a strict Marwari family where alcohol, boys and going out late at night is a big no no. That doesn't mean one doesn't find ways to do all of that. Just that the frequency is way way lesser than someone who comes from a liberal household. Anyways, when this guy was telling me about parties, I told him I haven't partied as much. And then he suddenly clammed up. He was of the mindset that if I haven't traveled much or partied much, then I wouldn't have any interesting stories to tell him. That I'd be having a fuck boring life. No matter that I'm well educated, that I love reading and writing, that I teach kids. None of that makes me interesting. So he said no before I could and that was the end of that.\\n\\nThe second guy I met last Sunday. He was a really sweet and simple guy. But he was a pucca devotee of Sadhguru. I met him for two hours and one hour out of that he talked about Sadhguru. I didn't even know who he was before this. Apparently there are a lot of rules in his 'scientific' teachings. About how coffee is bad. Tea is bad. Garlic is bad. And this guy was telling me how he would expect me to not have these food items. I love coffee! I told him so. I asked what would be his reaction if even after his explanations and the rationalizations of Sadhguru I still wanted to drink coffee daily. He said he'd look down on me. He believes everything that comes out of Sadhgurus mouth. Said he was 'The mother of the world.' I don't know. Maybe I'm not that intellectual, may be I don't have that maturity to understand these talks. To me, it all sounded a bit much. I came home and researched this guruji and to me, it just seems like a cult with Sadhguru saying things that he has no knowledge about. \\n\\nThe reason for this extremely long rant is that my parents understood my point. They were completely fine with my decision of not going forward with this guy. But I could see the tension creep back into my father's shoulders, the worry lines being more pronounced on his face. The sinking feeling that now he will have to start looking for someone again, and go through the whole process again and how we are already late at getting married and a hundred other things. Logically, I know that all of this is bullshit. That there is no age bar for marriage. But when you hear the same things from society day in and day out, about how you're so old, how there are no prospects, how the chances of your happiness are dwindling (I don't believe that marriage is a secret pill to happiness, btw) then subconsciously it seeps into you. And more than that, I can't get rid of the guilt that I'm the reason for my father's stress. That if I wasn't a girl, if he didn't have this responsibility then he wouldn't have to spend sleepless nights.\\n\\nI haven't been able to sleep since two nights because of this and didn't know who to talk to. I thought maybe someone from this sub could relate because arranged marriages are a complex topic which have a shit ton of stigma against it (not unwarranted.) \\n\\nAnyways, sorry for the rant and thank you so much for listening.\",\n",

So he said no before I could and that was the end of that.\\n\\nThe second guy I met last Sunday. He was a really sweet and simple guy. But he was a pucca devotee of Sadhguru. I met him for two hours and one hour out of that he talked about Sadhguru. I didn't even know who he was before this. Apparently there are a lot of rules in his 'scientific' teachings. About how coffee is bad. Tea is bad. Garlic is bad. And this guy was telling me how he would expect me to not have these food items. I love coffee! I told him so. I asked what would be his reaction if even after his explanations and the rationalizations of Sadhguru I still wanted to drink coffee daily. He said he'd look down on me. He believes everything that comes out of Sadhgurus mouth. Said he was 'The mother of the world.' I don't know. Maybe I'm not that intellectual, may be I don't have that maturity to understand these talks. To me, it all sounded a bit much. I came home and researched this guruji and to me, it just seems like a cult with Sadhguru saying things that he has no knowledge about. \\n\\nThe reason for this extremely long rant is that my parents understood my point. They were completely fine with my decision of not going forward with this guy. But I could see the tension creep back into my father's shoulders, the worry lines being more pronounced on his face. The sinking feeling that now he will have to start looking for someone again, and go through the whole process again and how we are already late at getting married and a hundred other things. Logically, I know that all of this is bullshit. That there is no age bar for marriage. But when you hear the same things from society day in and day out, about how you're so old, how there are no prospects, how the chances of your happiness are dwindling (I don't believe that marriage is a secret pill to happiness, btw) then subconsciously it seeps into you. And more than that, I can't get rid of the guilt that I'm the reason for my father's stress. That if I wasn't a girl, if he didn't have this responsibility then he wouldn't have to spend sleepless nights.\\n\\nI haven't been able to sleep since two nights because of this and didn't know who to talk to. I thought maybe someone from this sub could relate because arranged marriages are a complex topic which have a shit ton of stigma against it (not unwarranted.) \\n\\nAnyways, sorry for the rant and thank you so much for listening.\"},\n",

It was the day after Christmas, me and 8 friends had been to a pub. The occasion was special because it was like a war coming to an end where the whole group (except me and another guy) unleashed fire at this girl for being a dick to a guy in class and almost getting him to commit suicide. Now, this girl has serious image problems and she just didn\\'t accept that she was putting the other guy down by boasting off about how she has an internship in the 3rd semester of college or how her dad got her a new car or how many guys are *lattoo* behind her and shit like that. The guy loves this girl, the girl takes great advantage of him to the extent where she told him she loves him and weeks later, told him she meant it as a friend. Nazar na lage aise premiyo ko, bc.\\n\\nBut whatever, bottom line, she had image problems and everybody hated her. Me and the other guy wanted to get the group together and for some weird fuckall reason, change her and make her a better person. So we went great lengths to patch things up. Now, that day, out of all the days that I have seen on this planet, I was feeling really really sick because of the pathetic chicken that the pub served. It doesn\\'t help that I had about 30ml of whiskey in me. I drink to the extent where I was scared I was an alcoholic, so 30ml isn\\'t too much for me. But, I couldn\\'t control my stomach and had to be on a toilet seat multiple times. My stomach was paining a lot and I decided to put a chair on the far end of the table which was easier for my multiple toilet trips. This girl wanted to sit next to me and put a chair there. Out of all the places in that restaurant, this was the only place that apparently the stupid CCTV did not cover properly.\\n\\nWe stayed there for 2 hours and during that time everybody was laughing and happy. After a week, college started and it was when I went to college I was pulled aside by two of my best friends who told me that this girl was going about telling people that I took advantage of her the other day we went to the pub. I was furious and I wanted to go talk to her, but my friends told me that the girl only will come and talk to me. Fair enough. They asked me to bunk the first half of college so that we can go talk to this girl. Again, I agreed. One of my friends called her and she asked us to come to her friend\\'s flat near college. We went there, but she didn\\'t show up. When we called her, she didn\\'t pick up. And since we knew this friend, we went to her friend\\'s flat and knocked. Surprise , surprise! Her friend knows nothing about this.\\n\\nHalf of my day ruined, I go back to college where this girl pulls me by the collar and tells me how I have ruined her life. She shouts and cries in the corridor and slaps me before running away. I couldn\\'t process what happened and my friends and I just walked away. Luckily, nobody saw this happen. In the second half, one of my friends went to class and got her out to talk to me and she told me a story that literally none of the other 6 people on the table believe.\\n\\nApparently, I grabbed her chest, locked her hands, bit her neck and tried to make out with her. All this, when I was so sick that I could barely walk and I spent most of my time with my head on the table because of stomach pain. And remember me visiting her friend\\'s apartment? That was apparently to threaten her to shut up. I was really keeping my cool, and I told her I was okay with going to the cops. Her boy toy had other plans, he wanted to get a bunch of goons and have me hacked to death right there. He started making his calls to \"guys\" and I just exclaimed \"what the fuck is going on?\".

His only negotiation was, \"you accept you have done it and I won\\'t call the guys.\"\\n\\nI again offered to go to the cops, but the girl declined because the \"Cops Always Favour Guys\". OKAY FUCK IT, FAIR ENOUGH! I offered to take them to the pub, get the CCTV footage and check. Now, the CCTV was placed in such a nice location that if I sat on the chair a ceiling piece would cover me in the footage. There was only footage of me putting my head on the table. Accessing this footage was also a big scene where we had to lie that our phone got stolen from the table and bribe the manager to just be able to SEE the footage on their computer. I spent money to see me put my head on the table. GREAT! Now, remember, there was no conclusive evidence of any of this. She said she didn\\'t want to see my face and I disgusted her. She asked me to stay away from her, never talk to her and I agreed.\\n\\nI offered her to approach the Ethic committee in college (which is very serious) and tell them to take into account everybody\\'s statement for the day to make a decision but she denied that also because \"college will side by you because you are a better student than me\".\\n\\nNext day, she goes about telling people that I CHOSE to sit in a strategic location so that I can be hidden from the CCTV and MADE her sit beside me so that I can take advantage of her.

       "  'post': '[My last post can be found here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bo0i33/okay_rindia_i_need_some_help_and_advice_to_handle)\\n\\nI read all of your replies. I talked to my colleagues. I read various articles, quora answers to similar questions.\\n\\nAll said the same thing - **have separate homes**.\\n\\nBut I will be frank to you guys. I am not finding it as equivalently simple. Here\\'s what happened in the last couple of weeks:\\n\\nSO is being put on hold/bench and would not be going to work from next week. She has some other family issues which are keeping her down, worried, scared and miserable. This means full time at home.\\nDad returned back from home, we had two lengthy 1 on 1 discussions over incident and some other things. He thinks SO\\'s \"down-ness, sadness, worry\" is all a sham, advised me not to watch Netflix because of its explicit content and that our PDA (holding hands, sweet talking) is not partnership - but \"lusty\".\\nWhile we were talking, both the times, mom came and joined us to put her points. During the first, she mimicked my SO in a way unacceptable to me. During the second, she asked who is supposed to look after the kitchen as SO had never entered the kitchen since they fought. We agreed that mom must take the control entirely as she would never let go of the control even if my SO takes it up. But the very next day, she again created a scene asking if SO never going to look/manage the kitchen or not. When I reminded her of the previous days agreement she said \"its not like that. she has to do at east something\". I was blank. This goes on where she says almost everyday \\'if SO has decided or what to not look after anything in the kitchen\\' compounded with \\'If I start talking then you guys will understand\\'. Dad keeps on telling me that I am just covering up for SO all the time and that \\'it will not be good for my \"sansaar\" (family) in future and I\\'ll have to face may problems because of this\\'. Every alternate day they take up some home improvement task and then say we are not supposed to do this, but you are - implying not me but SO. Dad is now acting all strange - can\\'t exactly describe.\\n\\nDuring all this, SO decided to recuse herself from the home entirely citing the toxicity in the environment. Well, no shit, that is a problem for my parents. She talks minimally or almost none at all. She has cried her eyes out in office washroom few days ago. She is very close to snapping off. I fear how would she be acting out, because it would be raining hell fire.\\n\\nMe? I am still fu**ed up. I took up all the tasks that they expected SO to do. But I still got the covering up dialogue. It\\'s not like they are satisfied with me doing things. Its like some things only she has to do. Every morning or evening/late evening I have to listen to some dialogue that destroys my mental peace. I begun to talk to myself again and I keep on replaying day\\'s or past incidents when I am at work, driving, bathing or just about any time randomly. I imagine what I could have said and how the outcome would be different. Every morning I wake up, I get this uneasy sick feeling in my stomach. Every day when time to leave office approaches, I get the same feeling and dread going home thinking today what.\\n\\nI took another approach after thinking it might give me a better direction to think. I **visited a therapist** and talked to her. She asked me \"what do you want me to do here?\". If I knew that, why would I look out for help? She suggested I take a transfer (not possible) or ask my SO to move out. She added that you parents are never wrong. She suggested I stop thinking as u/obviothrowamisafe but rather think as son of my father. They biggest shocker was when she added the cliched dialogue -\"**You know SO from only 8 years but your relation with parents exists since my birth. Think about them, you are what you are today only and only because of them**\". I was more confused and upset when I left her clinic.\\n\\nToday, SO went in a minor breakdown some time ago over phone while in her office. Said I staying over at a friends place. I think it was because I was urging her to salvage the relationship and then move out so that there are less bitter feelings. But may be I am being too optimistic.\\n\\nReading about mental health, I have realised mum is narcissistic (aren\\'t most Indian parents?), SO might be borderline, depressed and has The Fear Of Acting Out. I am anxious, stressed.\\n\\n**Most importantly, I am guilty**.

       "  'all': '[NP] [R] Update to my previous post for help in handling a situation. [My last post can be found here.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bo0i33/okay_rindia_i_need_some_help_and_advice_to_handle)\\n\\nI read all of your replies. I talked to my colleagues. I read various articles, quora answers to similar questions.\\n\\nAll said the same thing - **have separate homes**.\\n\\nBut I will be frank to you guys. I am not finding it as equivalently simple. Here\\'s what happened in the last couple of weeks:\\n\\nSO is being put on hold/bench and would not be going to work from next week. She has some other family issues which are keeping her down, worried, scared and miserable. This means full time at home.\\nDad returned back from home, we had two lengthy 1 on 1 discussions over incident and some other things. He thinks SO\\'s \"down-ness, sadness, worry\" is all a sham, advised me not to watch Netflix because of its explicit content and that our PDA (holding hands, sweet talking) is not partnership - but \"lusty\".\\nWhile we were talking, both the times, mom came and joined us to put her points. During the first, she mimicked my SO in a way unacceptable to me. During the second, she asked who is supposed to look after the kitchen as SO had never entered the kitchen since they fought. We agreed that mom must take the control entirely as she would never let go of the control even if my SO takes it up. But the very next day, she again created a scene asking if SO never going to look/manage the kitchen or not. When I reminded her of the previous days agreement she said \"its not like that. she has to do at east something\". I was blank. This goes on where she says almost everyday \\'if SO has decided or what to not look after anything in the kitchen\\' compounded with \\'If I start talking then you guys will understand\\'. Dad keeps on telling me that I am just covering up for SO all the time and that \\'it will not be good for my \"sansaar\" (family) in future and I\\'ll have to face may problems because of this\\'. Every alternate day they take up some home improvement task and then say we are not supposed to do this, but you are - implying not me but SO. Dad is now acting all strange - can\\'t exactly describe.\\n\\nDuring all this, SO decided to recuse herself from the home entirely citing the toxicity in the environment. Well, no shit, that is a problem for my parents. She talks minimally or almost none at all. She has cried her eyes out in office washroom few days ago. She is very close to snapping off. I fear how would she be acting out, because it would be raining hell fire.\\n\\nMe? I am still fu**ed up. I took up all the tasks that they expected SO to do. But I still got the covering up dialogue. It\\'s not like they are satisfied with me doing things. Its like some things only she has to do. Every morning or evening/late evening I have to listen to some dialogue that destroys my mental peace. I begun to talk to myself again and I keep on replaying day\\'s or past incidents when I am at work, driving, bathing or just about any time randomly. I imagine what I could have said and how the outcome would be different. Every morning I wake up, I get this uneasy sick feeling in my stomach. Every day when time to leave office approaches, I get the same feeling and dread going home thinking today what.\\n\\nI took another approach after thinking it might give me a better direction to think. I **visited a therapist** and talked to her. She asked me \"what do you want me to do here?\". If I knew that, why would I look out for help? She suggested I take a transfer (not possible) or ask my SO to move out. She added that you parents are never wrong. She suggested I stop thinking as u/obviothrowamisafe but rather think as son of my father. They biggest shocker was when she added the cliched dialogue -\"**You know SO from only 8 years but your relation with parents exists since my birth. Think about them, you are what you are today only and only because of them**\". I was more confused and upset when I left her clinic.\\n\\nToday, SO went in a minor breakdown some time ago over phone while in her office. Said I staying over at a friends place. I think it was because I was urging her to salvage the relationship and then move out so that there are less bitter feelings. But may be I am being too optimistic.\\n\\nReading about mental health, I have realised mum is narcissistic (aren\\'t most Indian parents?), SO might be borderline, depressed and has The Fear Of Acting Out. I am anxious, stressed.\\n\\n**Most importantly, I am guilty**. Guilty of this situation and being single handedly responsible for it.\\n\\nQuestion is: **what now**?\\n\\n**TLDR: situation is worse than it was. This might cost me my relationship.**\\n\\n**LATE UPDATE**:\\nSo, one of the things I want to clarify is that my SO is still my GF. We have been in a live in relationship, and now my parents moved in with us. I had a general feeling from all replies that SO=wife was the assumption.\\n\\nNevertheless, things are good and bad. We are still together in this situation, and it\\'s good on somedays and bad on most.'},\n",

       "  'post': \"Hey all! This is going to be a pretty long post. Thank you for taking the time to read this.\\n\\nI was a intellectual kid till my 10th grade. I was scoring good and was very much interested in academics. I won multiple national level technical competitions in my 11th grade and I started flying. I was wrongly influenced by the articles on the internet criticizing traditional education(the ones that motivate you to drop out) and quickly lost interest in education. Just studied to pass exams without understanding anything. I learnt to code from my 6th grade. 9th grade was when I gotten my hands on C, till then I was just playing around with BASIC,FORTRAN,HTML,etc. Just when I started getting better with C, I got bored of learning it in the traditional way. I stopped learning it properly.. I just wanted to build cool programs and started googling and using stack exchange to build what I want. To be honest I was just building a program by copying blocks of code from the internet.... Quickly stopped that even doing that.\\nI am not from a very well to do family. My parents risked it all to put me in a top tier private university. They took loans to be able to afford my education. In my college, I took part in multiple tech teams and built many things. While I built things combining bits and pieces of information on the internet, I never really learnt anything in the process. I flunked in exams. I just memorised huge paragraphs only to write in the exam and forget. Passed out of college this year with a very mediocre GPA. The placements in our college wasn't any good. I couldn't get into the 1 or 2 companies that I tried off-campus. \\nI have to start paying my education loan installments.. My parents are very supportive and told me that they would take care of it and asked me to do what I want to. But I feel like shit giving them more burdens even after they had done so much for me.\\nMost of my friends are placed or they are pursuing masters. Everyone around me feels I'm very talented and is suprised about the fact that I still haven't got a job. But I feel I am really not that talented.\\nIt has it me hard that I have wasted around 6-7 years of my life. I have been a jack of few trades and King of none. The easy availability of solutions in the internet has  stopped me from thinking for a solution by myself. The result is a stupdier me. \\nUff, it been a long rant.  \\nComing to what I wanted to ask...\\nI want to write good software... That's what I want to do. I want to be a professional developer. If I choose to do it right this time, I am sure I would need atleast an year or two to be able to be employed atleast in the junior level. Given my financial situation I cannot afford to be jobless for more than a month or two at the worst. I really don't know what I should. I lost all motivation and confidence... I am literally feeling like shit everyday. Hoping to hear good suggestions from y'all... Thanks! \\n\\n TL;DR : A fucked up kid out of college with no job and a very tight financial situation seeking suggestions on what to do next.\",\n",

Thank you for taking the time to read this.\\n\\nI was a intellectual kid till my 10th grade. I was scoring good and was very much interested in academics. I won multiple national level technical competitions in my 11th grade and I started flying. I was wrongly influenced by the articles on the internet criticizing traditional education(the ones that motivate you to drop out) and quickly lost interest in education. Just studied to pass exams without understanding anything. I learnt to code from my 6th grade. 9th grade was when I gotten my hands on C, till then I was just playing around with BASIC,FORTRAN,HTML,etc. Just when I started getting better with C, I got bored of learning it in the traditional way. I stopped learning it properly.. I just wanted to build cool programs and started googling and using stack exchange to build what I want. To be honest I was just building a program by copying blocks of code from the internet.... Quickly stopped that even doing that.\\nI am not from a very well to do family. My parents risked it all to put me in a top tier private university. They took loans to be able to afford my education. In my college, I took part in multiple tech teams and built many things. While I built things combining bits and pieces of information on the internet, I never really learnt anything in the process. I flunked in exams. I just memorised huge paragraphs only to write in the exam and forget. Passed out of college this year with a very mediocre GPA. The placements in our college wasn't any good. I couldn't get into the 1 or 2 companies that I tried off-campus. \\nI have to start paying my education loan installments.. My parents are very supportive and told me that they would take care of it and asked me to do what I want to. But I feel like shit giving them more burdens even after they had done so much for me.\\nMost of my friends are placed or they are pursuing masters. Everyone around me feels I'm very talented and is suprised about the fact that I still haven't got a job. But I feel I am really not that talented.\\nIt has it me hard that I have wasted around 6-7 years of my life. I have been a jack of few trades and King of none. The easy availability of solutions in the internet has  stopped me from thinking for a solution by myself. The result is a stupdier me. \\nUff, it been a long rant.  \\nComing to what I wanted to ask...\\nI want to write good software... That's what I want to do. I want to be a professional developer. If I choose to do it right this time, I am sure I would need atleast an year or two to be able to be employed atleast in the junior level. Given my financial situation I cannot afford to be jobless for more than a month or two at the worst. I really don't know what I should. I lost all motivation and confidence... I am literally feeling like shit everyday. Hoping to hear good suggestions from y'all... Thanks! \\n\\n TL;DR : A fucked up kid out of college with no job and a very tight financial situation seeking suggestions on what to do next.\"},\n",

Deep packet inspection\\n2. Carrier-grade NAT\\n3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6\\n4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options\\n5. Clueless customer service, who just say \"we can\\'t talk about X or Y or Z\" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they\\'ll say they can\\'t help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. \\n\\nThe first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.\\n\\nTo explain in more detail:\\n\\n1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.\\n2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.\\n * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.\\n3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven\\'t really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.\\n * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.\\n4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.\\n5. Jio\\'s customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don\\'t have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won\\'t even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.\\n * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!\\n\\nI will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It\\'s not ideal, but I\\'m kinda stuck with that one.',\n",

       "  'post': \"So this is going to be long, but please bear with me.\\n\\n**Tldr: Mom and SO had showdown last night over difference of opinion/eating habits and verbally removed each other from the house**\\n\\n**Background:**\\nI have always been what might be considered a good child of my parents. I have had a pretty normal childhood with parental support and beatings both (the usual Indian scenario). Consider them to be semi narcissist. I don't connect with people well. With some I really do, but I generally don't. I am not very interested in keeping/bearing the weight of/carrying forward all the relations my parents have constructed. I think I am best defined as aloof. I doesn't mean I am an introvert. I can talk and converse with just about everyone. I am an accepting/non judgemental person, I am like to keep company of people who are non judgemental too. I also try to stay away from limelight, or more so - I ain't an attention seeker.\\n\\nI believe in simple things - everyone has a right to opinion, and you should never impose your opinions on others. Respect everyone's opinions, and JUST LET PEOPLE BE.\\n\\nSince I was a kid, I have done things according to my parents desires/rules/frameworks. I have no complaints and qualms regarding that. Fast forward to college, I develop opinions of my own. I raise questions, just be told this is how it is and I should look up proofs/reasons on internet myself. I would do that too, but only to be refuted if my report wasn't supporting their beliefs/thoughts. By college I was already distant. Had left my school friends behind, and had a new set now. (this is how I am. I leave college, no college friends any more. I leave office, no old office friends anymore. My reason - i don't want something to end up affecting those sweet memories I have of them. Overdoing things ruins them). This is the time I also understand the need for independence. And you are never independent unless you are financially firm too. Education and house rent aside I haven't taken money from my dad. I don't wish to, and I want to keep it like that.\\n\\nMeanwhile, during college, I fall in love with a great girl (calling her L), very opinionated and a different background/upbringing than me. This background is a huge cause of her personality overall and I like that. Most families have this issue where people say yes/okay/good stuff in front of you, but have this huge emotional baggage filled with things they have problems with. Heck, even my family does. Dad has issues with mom he does not speak about to her, mom has issues with dad she doesn't speak up and a vicious cycle of this extended far beyond in many other relationships. L's family doesn't have this to the level my family has. Her family is more like put your opinions. talk/discuss/quarrel and get over with it. So you always know the picture as it is always open.\\n\\nWhen I informed my parents of my relation, they were shocked, but ended up supporting me in the long run. Few dialogues were thrown here and there, but they were on board eventually. Today - and pretty much more than 10 times in past two months, they pride themselves with the idea that they accepted my relation and did not say no. It would have been one thing if they had said no and there would have been a chaos and mentioned it, but it's altogether a different thing when they 'accept' and keep on saying it every other day. They were also all over the place when they found out officially that L and I was in a live-in and they also keep saying that we accepted that too because we trust you (meaning we trust you to no sleep with each other)\\n\\nIn all this time, I create a life of my own. My ways, rules, habits, clothing styles, sleeping times, etc. L has her own ways and we don't interfere in each others ways and opinions unless absolutely needed. L's parents don't know about her being in live-in officially though they have an idea it might be the case. The reason she doesn't tell them is because they would marry her off to me, something we were not ready for until now.\\n\\nTo summarise out journey - we have been together since 2011 and living together since 2014. We have bought furniture together, redecorated homes and all that other stuff.\\n\\nFast forward to this year. Dues to some unforeseen circumstances, I am looking for a new flat on rent. Due to some other, my parents suggest we live together. I get a 3 bedroom on rent and move in. Parents join 2 weeks later. The house now has 4 adults living together. Me and L each get a bedroom (haha), my parents get 1. It's nice experiment according to me to let L learn and adjust to her future in-laws. Keeping my parents at our hometown is a bad idea obviously because of their ailing health and (by Indian standards - 58+) old age.\\n\\nThings start to change. my 6 see through tins that store spices become one flat box with mini bowls. Kitchen gets revampled My habits are not the one's they put in me so I am not a good child any more. I eat at random times, I sleep and wake up late, I don't go to office early, I don't leave office after 9 hours, I take too much time to get ready etc. etc.\\n\\nI have been wearing boxers at home since 4 years or so. But now it's indecent and I asked (read forced) to wear full pants or thick 3/4ths only. If I step out of the room/found in my room in boxers I am questioned about why am I not wearing any pants. I man can't you see the climate's shit and its too hot for pants?\\n\\nCuisine is a big issue. Right from amount of salt in the food to the habit of asafoetida in each and everything that leaves a burning feeling in the tummy, just to be reasoned that no, it's important and is not an issue. Red Lentils are evidently the father of chicken and must not be eaten on Mondays and Thursdays. Did I mention about non-veg? Absolutely none on Mondays, Thursdays and only outside home on Saturday. Stale non-veg item from Sunday must be kept till Tuesday but must not be consumed on Monday, however high might be your desire to do so. Frankly, these things are not part of L's background. Her family has never known veg/non-veg days and she isn't used to it. Personally, I am also not fond of these restrictions. I don't even identify as a theist. Probably agnostic. But beyond this all, I do believe that a person's wish to eat something surpassed any damn God around.\\n\\nThere are other minor things too, like playing bhajans on the speaker every morning in bedroom, while sitting themselves in hall busy on Facebook on their phones. Don't even get me started on the amount of misinformation that seeps via TV and phones, which they tend to believe for any reason possible.\\n\\nAdd to this that I was told (by parents) few weeks ago parents are my responsibility now and they are free from their duties - with a consistent reminder that sister >>>> wife/partner.\\n\\n**Now:**\\nDinner scene. L, Mom and me were having food that had rice, dal, left over butter chicken and rotis. L was done with butter chicken and roti and took some rice to go with the dal in her plate. She cleaned the spatula with her 'food hand' and was about to dip it in the rice container again when Mom asked her to stop. L was like why? Mom went on with no its Monday tomorrow and no one will be able to eat the rice (was more in quantity). L was like I'll finish it tomorrow. Mom was like no, no 'stained' food on Monday. This went on for a minute or two when L dropped (read banged) the spatula and went away.\\n\\nThis now became a food disrespect issue and Mom went on about it when L came back to eat and said something like you guys do everything and then come up with rules like these. Mom went on for some time. In all this, I finished my food and washed my hands when she again started with L should tell me what she means by we do everything. At this moment L lost it and what followed was as world war. L was like you can't impose your restrictions on me. I was trying to convince mom that let her have her own opinions, etc. L added she had never followed Mondays and wasn't going to. Mom went on with you'll have to, no option - and you have to do it after marriage too. L was like if you are going to put so many restrictions before marriage, I don't want to get married anymore. Mom was like if you don't want to marry, then you can't stay here like this. Then L said it's not your home, it's obviothrowamisafe's home. well, you can probably guess next how it went from audacity of L before marriage to how can she say like that and etc.\\n\\nI lost my cool here and just asked everyone to keep quiet. I called up dad who was out of town and relayed it to him. Mom gave her version, dad said to me afterwards we'll talk when I return and I'll decide whether or not to stay together anymore.\\n\\nTears everywhere, L was out of home cooling (read crying) in the garden. We talked a lot of stuff, and she even suggested moving out of home to a PG or some place. We returned, L went on later to say sorry and that she had lost her temper, but Mom was going on about how hurt she is and she can never forget and how she has always been good to L and accepted her in the family. This even got compounded with another sister >>>> wife/partner reminder as now she is scared about what would happen to her in her future. And more lines about how she is sad that her relations with her brothers aren't good/don't exist anymore (due to various reasons).\\n\\nToday morning was silent treatment day. L has been crying in her office's bathroom stall. I am unable to concentrate on work.\\n\\nRandians, I am dead here.\\n\\nI love my parents, They love me. I love L, She loves me. I can't decide one over the another. One is my life partner, one is my mother. More so, I am not emotionally, psychologically in a position to even decide something like this. My goals, aspirations, life everything will take a hit.\\nI don't even see a simpler solution here. I/We can play along with the desires of my parents, but to what ends? Some or the other day this is going to end up in a showdown.\\n\\nI want to be independent, but I don't want my parents to leave this house with bitterness. I want them to feel welcomed here. I don't want to loose L, and moving out from a 4 year live in for 6-7 months till we get married seems stupid.\\n\\nTo top it all, I was asked a yes-no question today - are you happy living with them? and I couldn’t  answer it.\\n\\nIt's complicated beyond my comprehensive abilities. What shall I do next?\\n\\n**EDIT**\\nThanks for all the replies everyone. I see most of you giving the 2 houses solution (which i do agree), but in reality shifting parents to new home seems a herculean task filled with Ekta Kapoor level drama. If we move out, it could still be the same scene.\\n\\nThings have cooled now, though L and mom aren't exactly interacting, but at least acknowledging each other. Time will tell what happens next.\\n\\nThank you again. wish you all good health and happiness.\\n\\n**EDIT 2**\\n\\nI kinda concur with most opinions here. but the act or mere discussion of such a solution is bound to feel blasphemous. add to it some Devil Vagina Magic kind of allegation and threat that L would pull me away/destroy the family.\\n\\n#dontdeadopeninside\",\n",

But beyond this all, I do believe that a person's wish to eat something surpassed any damn God around.\\n\\nThere are other minor things too, like playing bhajans on the speaker every morning in bedroom, while sitting themselves in hall busy on Facebook on their phones. Don't even get me started on the amount of misinformation that seeps via TV and phones, which they tend to believe for any reason possible.\\n\\nAdd to this that I was told (by parents) few weeks ago parents are my responsibility now and they are free from their duties - with a consistent reminder that sister >>>> wife/partner.\\n\\n**Now:**\\nDinner scene. L, Mom and me were having food that had rice, dal, left over butter chicken and rotis. L was done with butter chicken and roti and took some rice to go with the dal in her plate. She cleaned the spatula with her 'food hand' and was about to dip it in the rice container again when Mom asked her to stop. L was like why? Mom went on with no its Monday tomorrow and no one will be able to eat the rice (was more in quantity). L was like I'll finish it tomorrow. Mom was like no, no 'stained' food on Monday. This went on for a minute or two when L dropped (read banged) the spatula and went away.\\n\\nThis now became a food disrespect issue and Mom went on about it when L came back to eat and said something like you guys do everything and then come up with rules like these. Mom went on for some time. In all this, I finished my food and washed my hands when she again started with L should tell me what she means by we do everything. At this moment L lost it and what followed was as world war. L was like you can't impose your restrictions on me. I was trying to convince mom that let her have her own opinions, etc. L added she had never followed Mondays and wasn't going to. Mom went on with you'll have to, no option - and you have to do it after marriage too. L was like if you are going to put so many restrictions before marriage, I don't want to get married anymore. Mom was like if you don't want to marry, then you can't stay here like this. Then L said it's not your home, it's obviothrowamisafe's home. well, you can probably guess next how it went from audacity of L before marriage to how can she say like that and etc.\\n\\nI lost my cool here and just asked everyone to keep quiet. I called up dad who was out of town and relayed it to him. Mom gave her version, dad said to me afterwards we'll talk when I return and I'll decide whether or not to stay together anymore.\\n\\nTears everywhere, L was out of home cooling (read crying) in the garden. We talked a lot of stuff, and she even suggested moving out of home to a PG or some place. We returned, L went on later to say sorry and that she had lost her temper, but Mom was going on about how hurt she is and she can never forget and how she has always been good to L and accepted her in the family. This even got compounded with another sister >>>> wife/partner reminder as now she is scared about what would happen to her in her future. And more lines about how she is sad that her relations with her brothers aren't good/don't exist anymore (due to various reasons).\\n\\nToday morning was silent treatment day. L has been crying in her office's bathroom stall. I am unable to concentrate on work.\\n\\nRandians, I am dead here.\\n\\nI love my parents, They love me. I love L, She loves me. I can't decide one over the another. One is my life partner, one is my mother. More so, I am not emotionally, psychologically in a position to even decide something like this. My goals, aspirations, life everything will take a hit.\\nI don't even see a simpler solution here. I/We can play along with the desires of my parents, but to what ends? Some or the other day this is going to end up in a showdown.\\n\\nI want to be independent, but I don't want my parents to leave this house with bitterness. I want them to feel welcomed here. I don't want to loose L, and moving out from a 4 year live in for 6-7 months till we get married seems stupid.\\n\\nTo top it all, I was asked a yes-no question today - are you happy living with them? and I couldn’t  answer it.\\n\\nIt's complicated beyond my comprehensive abilities. What shall I do next?\\n\\n**EDIT**\\nThanks for all the replies everyone. I see most of you giving the 2 houses solution (which i do agree), but in reality shifting parents to new home seems a herculean task filled with Ekta Kapoor level drama. If we move out, it could still be the same scene.\\n\\nThings have cooled now, though L and mom aren't exactly interacting, but at least acknowledging each other. Time will tell what happens next.\\n\\nThank you again. wish you all good health and happiness.\\n\\n**EDIT 2**\\n\\nI kinda concur with most opinions here. but the act or mere discussion of such a solution is bound to feel blasphemous. add to it some Devil Vagina Magic kind of allegation and threat that L would pull me away/destroy the family.\\n\\n#dontdeadopeninside\"},\n",

Few professional lawyers have also messaged me offering professional support out of pure altruism. I am sorry I couldn't thank you all personally but I went home and got busy.\\n\\nSo today the first thing I've had an early appointment with an investigator who has previously worked with Police in various capacities. I am getting ahead of myself. I should tell you that I have made earlier post from office on my work laptop, just before leaving for the day. Today I called up office and informed that I might not report to work and picked my home laptop and drove up to PI's office. \\n\\nWhile I am discussing, he PI recommended that I'd have my laptop checked and I agreed. After half an hour a young guy (another employee) walks in and I handover my laptop to him. After few minutes the young guy signals through the window and PI walks out and talks to him. They both return back, along with the laptop to tell me the news that my laptop is bugged with some program which saves everything I type and also allows anyone to log into my system without password and use all my applications.\\n\\nI got worried and asked them if they could prove it to me. So I typed few sentences on notepad and the young guy (computer expert) repeated what I've written back to me word by word. Then I was asked to reboot and the computer expert showed me that he could use my system from his system. Yes I can recognize my folders, files, my desktop everything.And then, he started chrome and it could directly log into all my email accounts. They kindly let me borrow one of their laptops for my personal use while the investigation is underway. \\n\\nAll this sounds like black magic to me. Am I being tricked here? \\n\\nI cannot understand why would my wife do this to me? Everything that I have and do is all her's and children. I'd consider my life to be meaningless without them. Now I am terrified of going home. What do I do? My hands are shaking so much that I can't type. I don't think I will be able to drive home. And I think I have fever now.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nAll of them are thinking that I am being scammed. I didn't expect that you would think so. May be I should have written this earlier. The computer expert guy showed me logs that are couple of months old which includes websites I have visited three months ago, emails I have written with my words that I remember that go back as far as four months. I purchased some video lectures on one website for my son (udemi), the only time I ever visited such a site that I don't even know about and I have them in the logs. This was around three months ago.\\n\\nNot only that the company caters services to very very dangerous people that you don't want to know about.\\n\\n**EDIT:**\\n\\nI was away talking to other people.\\n\\nGuys, appreciate all the help that you are doing. It's my bad that I didn't write it in full. I was too devastated to capture everything that happened since today morning. **I am 99.99% sure that I am not being scammed**. Why not 100%, I don't know. I am not sure if you have engaged with professional private investigating agencies. I have (though not for technical activities such as this). The first and foremost important thing is **trust**. That's their bread and butter. Next is references. Even if anyone of you is willing to help me I wouldn't take it. I'll tell you why\\n\\n1. References. I'll need trusted references from people that you have serviced earlier\\n2. Can you have all my cards, pin numbers, every piece of information that is mine and still not touch a single rupee in my accounts? Yeah, I'll need references that you are that trustworthy\\n3. If I keep a 5 meter pile of cash in your custody, can you keep watch for months to end without touching it? Yeah, I'll need references that you are that trustworthy\\n4. Can you keep life threatening secrets and not leak it to anyone for years on end? Yeah I'll need references that you are that trustworthy\\n5. You **must not** hire a security agency with whom you cannot trust your laptop let alone extremely personal information.\\n6. Do you have reach into deep deep political/technical/banking/bureaucratic/law enforcement networks? And all that reach that you have are equally trustworthy?\\n\\nAnd there are many many more. None of you out here probably won't qualify ALL of these. The PI that was recommended ticks all these check boxes and more.\\n\\nAnd importantly, should I tell anyone that I am being scammed by this agency, I'll tell you that there will be few heads that will roll and few will be dead. No It's not that I would do it. There are much bigger people (few of them that have recommended me to this agency) will immediately catch the wind of it and they would like to protect themselves and **simply eliminate any threat they perceive**, real or not.\\n\\n\\nThe issue here is NOT technical. It's **legal**. Yesterday many people commented that I must not spy on my wife. Today I found that I am being spied on. And unfortunately I could not talk to my lawyer for amount of time today as he was caught up with some personal problem. I was advised by my lawyer get my heath checked up and try to avoid having meals back at home. I was also advised if I could work and live away from home for some period of time till dust settles. \\n\\nCould you look at through legal angle and tell me what does this mean?

May be things have changed a little because I studied it in school some 12 years ago, but given our educational system I doubt it. (for eg. it still says in NCERT physics book that glass is a semi solid and it flows slowly when this was debunked as a myth decades ago).\\n\\nWhen we read world wars in school, the only focus was on diplomacy, most of the chapters were on establishing who were the two sides that are fighting, who are the axis and who are the allies. That coupled with dates as usual. There was no mention at all of Indian involvement or Indian soldiers fighting in WW I for example.

       "  'all': \"Saw a post on askreddit asking Italians how world Wars are taught there, it made me think how it is taught in India, and its really sad.. It's horrible how World wars are taught in India. May be things have changed a little because I studied it in school some 12 years ago, but given our educational system I doubt it. (for eg. it still says in NCERT physics book that glass is a semi solid and it flows slowly when this was debunked as a myth decades ago).\\n\\nWhen we read world wars in school, the only focus was on diplomacy, most of the chapters were on establishing who were the two sides that are fighting, who are the axis and who are the allies. That coupled with dates as usual. There was no mention at all of Indian involvement or Indian soldiers fighting in WW I for example.

Part of why I am writing this is often people devalue the strength of online communities in the growing waves of a global tech-lash. We often concentrate on the problems of abuse, loss of privacy or, mental distraction (*as we should*) but also forget the benefits of why we keep using these tools (*as we should not*). Here is a short thank you note explaining what the Reddit community means to us at IFF and how it is becoming instrumental in charting our journey.\\n\\nOver the past few months we have actively engaged on Reddit and shared how we are building out an effective organisation to fight for our digital rights. But what are digital rights? Many do not even understand what privacy means? And to those who it does make sense, they do not see any clear path to winning on such battles. That is why IFF exists. We want to champion the ideals of fundamental rights with technology. A core part of this idea is enriching public debate. Through public engagement (*like here*) and making ordinary people stakeholders in the formulation of tech policy -- letting them know what's happening in our courts and government ministries. Even to make it fun and make it easier for them to participate!\\n\\nAlong with conversation what also matters are solid wins which come through institutional engagement. Some of our recent work demonstrates we can achieve public victories on important issues such as Section 66A, online streaming, internet shutdowns and net neutrality. This impact comes through first with small but tangible steps which seem incremental but build into giant leaps over time. None of this would have been possible without all of you. Most of the community here has been overwhelmingly supportive of our work. Has been curious, engaged and questioned us to do better. We could not ask for more. But we do when it comes to money (*which for us is not a bad word*).\\n\\nTo us money means resources which we strive to use effectively. That can strengthen our mission, primarily through staffing the best talent and building a team of digital rights all-stars. Here the Reddit community has been a tremendous boost to our work. A lot of the financial support for IFF has come in totalling to about 2.7 lakhs in the past three months. This is what we like to call grass-route(r) donations. Presently, in a given month we average about 80-90 donations and now with a monthly subscription plan that we built out we have 40 members (we started with zero donations in October and about 30 in November). Yes, these are modest figures even for a non-profit like us, but are have helped pay costs and hire people. They have demonstrated that IFF provides a valuable social service and many people are there to support it.\\n\\nOne area which is on the top of my mind --- where we can be better -- is involving volunteers. While many volunteers are working with us, we have lost many others due to a lack of interest.

The International Consortium of International Journalists (ICIJ) and a team of more than 250 reporters and data specialists from 58 news organisations in 36 countries examined hundreds of cases to investigate various aspects of the medical device industry — regulation, faulty devices and corruption. The ICIJ and its partners filed more than 1,500 public records requests and collected more than 8 million device-related records, including recall notices, safety warnings, legal documents and corporate financial filings. More than 5.4 million “adverse event” reports sent by various countries to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the last decade make up the greatest share.\\n\\n-\\n\\n**What are its main findings?**\\n\\n> First, that governments in dozens of countries in Africa, South America and Asia don’t regulate medical devices, instead placing their trust in European authorities or in the US FDA.\\n\\n> Second, medical devices that broke, misfired, corroded, ruptured or otherwise malfunctioned after implantation or use — despite assurances by regulators, the industry and doctors that they were safe — were linked to 1.7 million injuries and nearly 83,000 deaths over the last decade. Nearly 5,00,000 reports mentioned an explant — a surgery to remove a device — in connection with an adverse event.\\n\\n> Third, that doctors and manufacturers often fail to report adverse events, and when they do the information can be unverified and incomplete.\\n\\n-\\n\\n**What is a medical device, and to what extent are these regulated in India?**\\n\\n> India’s regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) broadly defines a medical device as any “instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, material, or other article” that is to be used, whether alone or in combination, for “diagnostic or therapeutic purposes”. Earlier, only 10 notified medical devices were regulated in India. This has since been broadened to 23 categories of devices. These mainly include syringes, needles, perfusion sets, in vitro devices for HIV treatment, catheters, intra-ocular lenses, cannulas, bone cements, heart valves, orthopaedic implants, coronary stents, IUDs and condoms.\\n\\n**How big is the market for medical devices in India?**\\n\\n> According to industry estimates cited on the Make in India website, the industry in India is currently valued at $5.2 billion and contributes 4-5% to the $96.7 billion Indian health care industry. The Indian medical device market is expected grow to $50 billion by 2025. Currently, India is the fourth largest medical devices market in Asia after Japan, China and South Korea.\\n\\n> Equipment and instruments constitute nearly 54% of the medical devices in the market; the other important segments are consumables and disposables that are mostly manufactured by Indian player, patients aids like hearing aids and pacemakers, various implants, and stents.\\n\\nRead more here:  [#ImplantFiles | An ICIJ-Express investigation: Why implants were probed](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implantfiles-an-icij-express-investigation-why-implants-were-probed-5464032/)\\n\\n---\\n\\nIndepth articles till now published on IE's portal: https://indianexpress.com/about/implant-files/\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [Big medical device bazaar: Faulty implants, basement surgeries, lives at risk](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/big-medical-device-bazaar-faulty-implants-basement-surgeries-lives-at-risk-5463991/)\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [New database tracks faulty medical devices across the globe](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/implant-files-new-database-tracks-faulty-medical-devices-across-the-globe-5464036/)\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [Frequently asked questions and resources for readers](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implant-files-frequently-asked-questions-and-resources-for-readers-5464041/)\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [9 am, Room No. 7, AIIMS – 2 out of 10 here have had an implant gone wrong |  From clinics in small towns to hospitals in big cities, victims of botched surgeries make a beeline to this OPD for a second shot](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implant-files-medical-surgery-9-am-room-no-7-aiims-2-out-of-10-here-has-had-an-implant-gone-wrong-5464033/).\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [Abbott coronary stents in 50 per cent adverse event reports for 2018.

       "  'all': \"After PanamaPapers, IndianExpress have teamed up for #ImplantFiles. In this year long investigation, it was found how faulty medical devices have been approved in dozens of countries including India ($5.2 billion market), based on approval from EU or US authorities and remains largely unchecked.. Introductory blog post: https://www.icij.org/blog/2018/11/icij-publishes-new-investigation-the-implant-files/\\n\\nVideo: [A global investigation into medical device harm | Implant Files](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZUzmA32Lbo)\\n\\nPodcast: [The Implant Files: How are faulty medical devices harming people across the world?](https://indianexpress.com/audio/3-things/the-implant-files-how-are-faulty-medical-devices-harming-people-across-the-world/5464306/)\\n\\n-\\n\\n\\n**What is the Implants Files investigation?**\\n\\n> It is a global examination of the medical device industry and its overseers. The International Consortium of International Journalists (ICIJ) and a team of more than 250 reporters and data specialists from 58 news organisations in 36 countries examined hundreds of cases to investigate various aspects of the medical device industry — regulation, faulty devices and corruption. The ICIJ and its partners filed more than 1,500 public records requests and collected more than 8 million device-related records, including recall notices, safety warnings, legal documents and corporate financial filings. More than 5.4 million “adverse event” reports sent by various countries to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the last decade make up the greatest share.\\n\\n-\\n\\n**What are its main findings?**\\n\\n> First, that governments in dozens of countries in Africa, South America and Asia don’t regulate medical devices, instead placing their trust in European authorities or in the US FDA.\\n\\n> Second, medical devices that broke, misfired, corroded, ruptured or otherwise malfunctioned after implantation or use — despite assurances by regulators, the industry and doctors that they were safe — were linked to 1.7 million injuries and nearly 83,000 deaths over the last decade. Nearly 5,00,000 reports mentioned an explant — a surgery to remove a device — in connection with an adverse event.\\n\\n> Third, that doctors and manufacturers often fail to report adverse events, and when they do the information can be unverified and incomplete.\\n\\n-\\n\\n**What is a medical device, and to what extent are these regulated in India?**\\n\\n> India’s regulator Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) broadly defines a medical device as any “instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, material, or other article” that is to be used, whether alone or in combination, for “diagnostic or therapeutic purposes”. Earlier, only 10 notified medical devices were regulated in India. This has since been broadened to 23 categories of devices. These mainly include syringes, needles, perfusion sets, in vitro devices for HIV treatment, catheters, intra-ocular lenses, cannulas, bone cements, heart valves, orthopaedic implants, coronary stents, IUDs and condoms.\\n\\n**How big is the market for medical devices in India?**\\n\\n> According to industry estimates cited on the Make in India website, the industry in India is currently valued at $5.2 billion and contributes 4-5% to the $96.7 billion Indian health care industry. The Indian medical device market is expected grow to $50 billion by 2025. Currently, India is the fourth largest medical devices market in Asia after Japan, China and South Korea.\\n\\n> Equipment and instruments constitute nearly 54% of the medical devices in the market; the other important segments are consumables and disposables that are mostly manufactured by Indian player, patients aids like hearing aids and pacemakers, various implants, and stents.\\n\\nRead more here:  [#ImplantFiles | An ICIJ-Express investigation: Why implants were probed](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implantfiles-an-icij-express-investigation-why-implants-were-probed-5464032/)\\n\\n---\\n\\nIndepth articles till now published on IE's portal: https://indianexpress.com/about/implant-files/\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [Big medical device bazaar: Faulty implants, basement surgeries, lives at risk](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/big-medical-device-bazaar-faulty-implants-basement-surgeries-lives-at-risk-5463991/)\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [New database tracks faulty medical devices across the globe](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/implant-files-new-database-tracks-faulty-medical-devices-across-the-globe-5464036/)\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [Frequently asked questions and resources for readers](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implant-files-frequently-asked-questions-and-resources-for-readers-5464041/)\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [9 am, Room No. 7, AIIMS – 2 out of 10 here have had an implant gone wrong |  From clinics in small towns to hospitals in big cities, victims of botched surgeries make a beeline to this OPD for a second shot](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/implant-files-medical-surgery-9-am-room-no-7-aiims-2-out-of-10-here-has-had-an-implant-gone-wrong-5464033/).\\n\\n-\\n\\n- [Abbott coronary stents in 50 per cent adverse event reports for 2018.

       "  'post': 'These are some generic tips on how to run a successful media campaign, based on my experience in winning one such fight which ended up reforming the education system in an entire state. I had previously given [an AMA here yesterday](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gziej/ama_i_orchestrated_a_protest_against_an/).  You can go through my [post history in reddit itself](https://np.reddit.com/user/HelpSaveStudents/submitted/) to see the proof of the campaign.\\n\\n**Lesson ONE : TEASER**\\n\\nFirstly you need to decide the type of the cause you are fighting for. Is it a breaking news material or is it a just-another-corruption/murder story? If it is a breaking news then go right ahead and inform the media otherwise, you need to plan the campaign.\\n\\nIn most cases, this is a LONG game. You are unlikely to get the result you want in one day, unless you have some super shocking news. So, be prepared to run the campaign for at-least one month. People forget easily. People have the attention span of a fly. They will definitely forget your *important-news* after reading it one time. For them, it is just another news among hundreds of news they read everyday. So, how can you succeed?\\n\\nYou need to release a new fresh news at-least once every two days. For this reason, NEVER give full details to the media on the first day itself. Instead, it should arrive in parts. Like, you reveal few information today, and it become a widely reported news. Then, after two days, you reveal more details, then it becomes another widely reported news about your cause. \\n\\nYou should decide the frequency based on the cause. For some causes concerning everyone like global warming or cancer, the frequency of once in three months would even be fine, but for a cause like death of a student, it needs to be faster. In my case, I chose a frequency of about one day because new information were pilling up.\\n\\nThis will help you keep your relevance in the news for a long time. Otherwise, your news will soon be sidelined. This is what happens to all those news which you see gain traction in media for one or two days and then completely disappear from the media forever. \\n\\n**Lesson TWO : MEDIUM**\\n\\nIn today\\'s digital age, you should take full advantage of the social media. Again, depending on the type of the cause, your medium might differ, but for me, the best medium was a Facebook Page. It connected everything together. \\n\\nYou might think about Whatsapp but, nah, dont do it. Put it on Facebook page, and you will be surprised to see that all whatsapp groups relating to your cause will start getting filled with the posts you posted on Facebook. Not everyone will be using Facebook, but someone will be and they will spread it thus multiplying the effect.\\n\\nYou can also sent the links to those facebook posts to reporters. Many of the news websites, now directly embed your facebook post and thus you will also gain lot of followers.\\n\\nThere are four ways to getting a media to report your news\\n\\n1. Contact the media by submitting your news in their contact us form in their website, or emailing to the email Id shown in their site. I found ZERO percent success with this even though I would have emailed to hundreds of media outlets.\\n2. Contacting the reporter by searching them in twitter or facebook, and then sending them a private message. This technique was successful. Some of those reporters became so useful that they will literally post every news we send to them within an hour.\\n3. Asking a reporters friend to ask the reporter to report about this news. If you know someone working in the media, this will be useful. In one case this helped us get TV documentary on the issue.\\n4. If you make a post on reddit or facebook etc, and if it gains enough tractions, the reporters will contact you. That is the best kindof way to get your news in the media as they themselves are interested in posting your news. Usually these are reporters of newer online-only media outlets like Scroll or Quint or websites of some facebook pages like Logical Indians or Youth ki Awazz. The initial [reddit post I made one year ago](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5mybd4/serious_a_student_committed_suicide_after_mental/) got my news featured in few of these sites.\\n\\nIf Big media is not reporting, then contact the small media. There are lot of low quality news websites which will pretty much report anything without checking the authenticity. Contact these news agencies. They will more likely report your news. Once these people report it, then your cause will gain momentem and it is more likely that big media will also start reporting.\\n\\nThe big media is reluctant to post any new unverified news fearing they will lose their reputation or it might hurt their stakeholders, however once small media starts actively reporting on the issue, they will be forced to report it. \\n\\nIn our case, our college was spending crores of rupees every year in ads with almost all of the media agencies. A huge media agency was also official partner with our college\\'s all events. And, thus the editors didn\\'t want to hurt their relation with one of their biggest client, so they refused to report our news. And, when they were forced to report, they used the word \"popular college\" instead of naming the college. They only started to report it properly after small media started to actively report it, and we started to ridicule big media by using comics.\\n\\nYou can also start a petition in change.org and publicize it.\\n\\n**Lesson THREE : INFLUENCER**\\n\\nGet the influencers to talk. Whatever an influencial person talks is news. It is free publicity. If you can get them to talk then do it. Remember that you might have three groups of influencers in your hand\\n\\n1. Contact the people who can be in support of you and inform them about this cause. If they talk, that is news. This includes movie stars, politicians, police officers, and even not-so-popular actors/sportsmen.\\n2. Remember that if a horrible incident has happened to a person, that person and their family can become the biggest influencer. However, it will work only after you gain medium level publicity. Anything a victim or victom\\'s family says is a news in today\\'s media.\\n3. Contact the people you are blaming. Get them to talk. Get them infront of a TV reporter. If they talk, that is news too. Infact, every time they say a controversial thing, that is a big bonus point to you. That one controversial sentence will become the title of the news while ignoring the hundred other things they said. Even if they do nothing controversial, that still is a news.\\n\\n**Lesson FOUR: MEME**\\n\\nMake Memes! Yes, make comics about your situation. Make jokes. Make it funny. Make it interesting. Make lot of them and send it to all the meme pages. Some admin will post it if you claim it is exclusive. In todays world, Memes work more than anything in this list. It will sway the opinion of the public in your favour. It will convey your message in the simplest manner possible.\\n\\nI would have created 100s of memes for my campaign. I had posted it on facebook on the days we had no big news. Memes used to get more likes than our serious posts. I even tried posting them to 9gag and got some likes. If you go through our facebook page, you will find hundreds of memes and comics.\\n\\nDo not underestimate the power of a good meme. I would even wager that our cause became successful mainly due to memes.\\n\\n**Lesson FIVE : UNITY**\\n\\nThere should be a unified front for your cause. The fight will lose power if different people within your group starts promoting differing versions of the story or starts projecting different problems. You should also focus on fighting one cause at a time. There can be multiple sub-casuses, but there should be one major cause which is the primal focus of your fight. \\n\\nIf you try to bring in more causes into a fight, then you will soon find that you are not focused and the fight will lose momentum. There are lot of problems in the world, but you cannot fight on multiple fronts at the same time and hope to win. You most likely do not have the resources to do that, so focus on one issue at a time. \\n\\nIt would be better if there is someone who can act as a spokesperson for the group, or someone who decides what content to be given to the media.\\n\\n**Lesson SIX : ONLINE**\\n\\nDo not underestimate the power of the internet. You might be staging an offline protest with hundreds of people, but that is it. You are a 100 people against the system. But, if you post the photos and videos of that protest online, and get supporters online, you get a huge force multiplier.\\n\\nEven though the people who see it in Facebook just like it or share it, it has a great power to put pressure on the system to correct itself. Post the videos of youtube. Send the videos to media.\\n\\nAt the same time, offline activism must also happen simultaneously. Otherwise, people might not take your protest seriously. You end up becoming just a bad reviewer and nothing else.\\n\\n**Lesson SEVEN : LOGIC**\\n\\nMake sure that all your actions are logically explainable. You should also state your reason for the fight in as simple but logically sound words as possible. An outsider should easily be able to understand why they should support your cause. \\n\\nSometimes the things which are obvious to you are not obvious to someone else of a different background. You should portray it in such a way that they can understand and relate themselves to the cause.\\n\\nYou should also have a reasonable proof or evidence for everything you say, otherwise you will soon lose momentum. It will end up just as acquisitions. Do not start your protest until you have at-least some proof. Once the protest has started, it might be too late to collect the proof as they can destroy the evidence.\\n\\nAfter the commencement of the protest, if someone threatens you, then file a formal case against them. If someone does anything illegal, file a case. Make sure to leave a paper trail. Having someone with the understanding of law will be helpful.\\n\\nIn our case, the culprits(including college chairman, vice principal, owners, professors etc) went into hiding as soon as the case became popular in the media. Police were not able to arrest them, and when they came out of the hiding, they had already got anticipatory bail from the court, thus they could not be arrested even though charges against them were for a non bailable offense. How cunning, right?\\n\\nHowever, what they didn\\'t see coming was another case of a student they had tortured couple of days before the death of Jishnu. They tortured him because he had sent letters to education minister, university and other government institutions citing the illegal activities happening in the college. They tortured him to force him to take back his complaints. But, we were able to get him to file a case against the culprits, and since they didn\\'t have an anticipatory bail for this case, they all were arrested and sent to jail for atleast few days until they got the bail.\\n\\nWe will go on to help people file atleast five cases against the college including death threats, illegal land acquiring, holding certificates of students as hostage etc.\\n\\n\\n**Lesson EIGHT : POLITICS**\\n\\nIf your cause starts becoming popular, the politicians or atleast low level party workers will start joining your protest. Believe it or not, they will start helping you in every way possible. They will bring in all the resources you need to protest. They will have the money to make posters and paste it on every wall. They will have the man power to stage a large protest. They will have control of atleast one or two media agencies. They will bring their own reporters. They will make quick make shift tents and stages for protesting. They will bring in their IT department who will handle the online media etc. \\n\\nThis will feel so overwhelming. You will feel like you finally can rest as now these people will handle it, but do not make that mistake. If you take rest now, they will surely hijack your movement and make it into a political show. Just keep in mind that their objectives are definitely different from yours. They do not really care about the issue, what they care about is political mileage.\\n\\nThey want to be seen as doing something for the people. They want to be in news headlines everyday. They is kindof their version of TEASER you learned in Lesson ONE. They need to maintain their frequency in news so that their party stay in the people\\'s mind when the election happens. They want to recruit more people to their parties as well.\\n\\nThe resources they bring in are similar to how circuses suddenly bring in all elephants, big tents and equipment to a location. Just like how these circuses are designed to move from location to location, the resources of the parties are designed to me moved from one cause to another at a moment\\'s notice. It is their daily job and they are not specially setting it up for you.\\n\\nMake full use of the resources these parties bring-in, but do NOT give full support to any party and do NOT let anyone take control of the movement. The moment you sides with one party, the other parties get offended and kindof becomes your opposition. Instead, what you want is all parties to work towards your goal, and that exactly was what happened in our campaign. There were some four parties working in our favor by the time it reached the final stages of protest. Each party had even setup their own separate facebook pages!\\n\\nAnd, this is when the college was well connected with politicians and they fund the parties as well. The accused owner is a son of a prominent minister of a major party. Yet, their party was finally forced to support the protest against him!\\n\\nNo matter how poorly you perceive these political parties, do not neglect them entirely. You absolutely need the resources they bring-in. You need them more than they need you. They are an essential part of the protest, so learn to live with that. It is a delicate balance of power.\\n\\n**Lesson NINE : EVERYONE\\'S PROBLEM**\\n\\nMost causes fail just due to this one single reason. They portray the cause as a one-off problem which only they are facing, and thus they do not see the big picture. Instead, you should fight for a cause which is generic problem for everybody. Your target shouldn\\'t be to just solve your issue, but your target should be to solve everyone\\'s problem related to that issue.\\n\\nSo, even if initially the cause was initiated because of one horrible incident, you must soon fight for everyone who has ever faced that problem. In our case, we started it off as a fight for justice in the case of mysterious death of one student caused due to a bad college management. That was the primary motivation, but we quickly made it into a generic issue faced by thousands of students around the state. And, we fought to bring a solution to the problem faced by everyone.\\n\\nThis lead to protests erupting in 100s of other colleges in the state. Our protest inspired them to join the moment and fight against the management to solve the issue. It even lead to shutting down of few extremely bad engineering colleges which was torturing students in much more intensity than we have ever faced.\\n\\nOne of the key people(a law student from another college) who voluntarily fought actively in this protest even though he was not at all related to this college went on to create an NGO for helping students fight injustice against bad colleges. You can see the website at LCSR.org.in and facebook page \"Your Lawyers Friend\"\\n\\n**Lesson TEN : SHARE IT**\\n\\nWriting \"Please share it so that more people can see it\" etc under the post has an effect even if you think it doesn\\'t. I have tested it and people are really more likely to share it if you remind them about it. This seems to be because people forget that they can do that.\\n\\nSimilarly, people are likely to help you if you ask them specifically to help. Otherwise, due to a psychological reason called Bystander\\'s effect, even capable people will become just mere spectators of your protest. You need to thus explicitly ask people to do certain things, and then only they will do it. Once they do it, they will feel like they are part of the movement, and will be more than happy to chirp in for next tasks themselves.\\n\\n\\n**Tl;DR** - Read it in case you need to stage a protest against an impossible force in India. These are just some generic tips to help you based on my experiences in [running a successful campaign.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gziej/ama_i_orchestrated_a_protest_against_an/)',\n",

       "  'all': 'A detailed guide on how to run a successful media campaign for a cause as an ordinary person. These are some generic tips on how to run a successful media campaign, based on my experience in winning one such fight which ended up reforming the education system in an entire state. I had previously given [an AMA here yesterday](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8gziej/ama_i_orchestrated_a_protest_against_an/).  You can go through my [post history in reddit itself](https://np.reddit.com/user/HelpSaveStudents/submitted/) to see the proof of the campaign.\\n\\n**Lesson ONE : TEASER**\\n\\nFirstly you need to decide the type of the cause you are fighting for. Is it a breaking news material or is it a just-another-corruption/murder story? If it is a breaking news then go right ahead and inform the media otherwise, you need to plan the campaign.\\n\\nIn most cases, this is a LONG game. You are unlikely to get the result you want in one day, unless you have some super shocking news. So, be prepared to run the campaign for at-least one month. People forget easily. People have the attention span of a fly. They will definitely forget your *important-news* after reading it one time. For them, it is just another news among hundreds of news they read everyday. So, how can you succeed?\\n\\nYou need to release a new fresh news at-least once every two days. For this reason, NEVER give full details to the media on the first day itself. Instead, it should arrive in parts. Like, you reveal few information today, and it become a widely reported news. Then, after two days, you reveal more details, then it becomes another widely reported news about your cause. \\n\\nYou should decide the frequency based on the cause. For some causes concerning everyone like global warming or cancer, the frequency of once in three months would even be fine, but for a cause like death of a student, it needs to be faster. In my case, I chose a frequency of about one day because new information were pilling up.\\n\\nThis will help you keep your relevance in the news for a long time. Otherwise, your news will soon be sidelined. This is what happens to all those news which you see gain traction in media for one or two days and then completely disappear from the media forever. \\n\\n**Lesson TWO : MEDIUM**\\n\\nIn today\\'s digital age, you should take full advantage of the social media. Again, depending on the type of the cause, your medium might differ, but for me, the best medium was a Facebook Page. It connected everything together. \\n\\nYou might think about Whatsapp but, nah, dont do it. Put it on Facebook page, and you will be surprised to see that all whatsapp groups relating to your cause will start getting filled with the posts you posted on Facebook. Not everyone will be using Facebook, but someone will be and they will spread it thus multiplying the effect.\\n\\nYou can also sent the links to those facebook posts to reporters. Many of the news websites, now directly embed your facebook post and thus you will also gain lot of followers.\\n\\nThere are four ways to getting a media to report your news\\n\\n1.

Please, tell me na.\\n\\nAnother observation that I have made is that people from colleges such as BITS speak good English, at least when you compare it to their peers' from IITs and NITs (and other government colleges of course). Here are my questions:\\n\\n1. Are my observations correct? Have you guys observed something similar?\\n2. If yes, then what might be the reason?\"},\n",

       "  'post': 'There have been numerous posts in the past week about how Facebook is in cahoots with the BJP. There were some strange accusatory posts like [this] (https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3n2z8o/questions_to_modi_at_facebook_hq_were_pr_managed/) and there have been some posts to gather information like [this](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3mu3n8/hey_rindia_im_looking_to_collect_evidenceaka/). One aspect of the debate is being ignored: Whether violating Net Neutrality will benefit the present government? How will the implementation of Internet dot org be advantageous to them? So here is my attempt at connecting the dots by putting out various events that have happened in the past.\\n\\nPlease note that I have used the term \"present government\" in the title and not BJP. I believe that any political party which comes to power would have done the same things that BJP is presently doing. The game is always about increasing influence and gaining power, regardless of ideology.\\n\\n**Social Media as an alternative to Mass Media**\\n\\nBefore the 2014 general elections, BJP was at a major disadvantage. The mass media was not very sympathetic to them and their ideology. A decade of Congress rule had put the TV & print media in a comfort zone which BJP was finding hard to penetrate. Using social media for spreading their message was a viable option and it was done really cleverly too.\\n\\nArvind Gupta, the BJP IT cell head, is quoted in a book by Lance Price titled \"The Modi Effect\": \\n\\n> “Our responses were totally dependent on them [mainstream media] and what they decided to report,” Price quotes Gupta as having said. “Social media changed the entire scenario.” [source](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/power-social-media-emboldened-right-wing-trolls#sthash.SIPrHaLz.dpuf)\\n\\nAnd now, as a result, you can see that every other story covered by MSM originates from Social Media websites.\\n\\n**Influx of the Hindu trolls**\\n\\n[This Caravan article](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/power-social-media-emboldened-right-wing-trolls) tells you a very tiny piece of the big story. \\n\\n> It is interesting to note that Modi hosted the 150 social networkers at his official residence on the occasion of the launch of the Digital India Campaign in Delhi. The prime minister could have easily taken up a digitally-enabled education or health project to kick-start his campaign; instead, he chose to meet people who have become a byword in online terror, hate and misogyny—a symbolism ignored by most, the press and the victims included. With Modi pushing for deepening of digitisation, the size and virtual power of his abusive online army will only increase in the days ahead in its political-ideological battle for a “Congress-mukt” Bharat, cold comfort for the likes of Ravish Kumar, Sagarika Ghose and the rest.\\n\\nTejinder Singh Bagga and the Great Bong on twitter are just two examples of how BJP has effectively used social media influencers to communicate with their supporters. Just go ahead and take a look at the PM\\'s personal twitter account. He follows 1229 people at the moment. A casual glance at the people he follows will give you a taste of his strategy on Twitter. There are a lot of verified Twitter handles he follows, but there are some unverified accounts which are used to spread BJP\\'s agenda. A lot of them have \"Followed by @narendramodi\" in their profile descriptions. \\n\\nVery cleverly done.\\n\\n**Growing influence of Facebook in India**\\n\\n[Facebook has added 13 million new users from India in the past 6 months](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/facebook-user-base-has-now-climbed-to-125-million-users-in-india-272186.html) taking the number to 125 million. The social media penetration in India (as of March 2015) is close to just 10%. [source](http://www.statista.com/statistics/255235/active-social-media-penetration-in-asian-countries/). Imagine the immense amounts of users that Facebook can gain by increasing penetration in India. \\n\\nOn top of this, Facebook is worried about its value in the market. An article from way back in 2012 points out that [Facebook is a bubble that will burst](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/facebook-is-a-bubble-and-it-will-burst-210345.html). One particular quote by Mahesh Murthy is very relevant today:\\n\\n> “There isn’t much scope for growth here, really – we’re beginning to run out of connected adults on the planet,” points out venture capitalist Mahesh Murthy on his Facebook page.\\n\\nTo stay afloat, Facebook has to add more users and show the investors that they are worth investing in. Internet dot org in India serves that purpose beautifully. (If someone here can help me add more latest figures to this, it will be rather helpful)\\n\\n***\\n\\nEDIT: [See this post by Mahesh Murthy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/internet-splinternet-facebooks-new-internetorg-just-evil-murthy) (EDIT: added the following text from the linked post)\\n\\n> Facebook has about the same number of users as Google: about 1.4 billion. That\\'s one out of five people on earth. And the social network made US$12.4 billion off them last year - that\\'s about US$ 8.65 per person on their service.\\nWhile Google made $66 billion off about the same number of people - almost $46 per head - a revenue efficiency more than 5 times that of Facebook. And that gap isn\\'t narrowing nearly fast enough.\\nRevenue growth to support Facebook\\'s stratospheric stock price at 60 times earnings is a big challenge, I\\'d imagine. Oh, and even at 5 times the revenue efficiency, Google\\'s P/E ratio is less than half of Facebook\\'s - so the pressure on the Facebook stock price can only increase with time.\\nThere\\'s only so much you can squeeze out of the first world - the current billion or so people - even though Facebook has cut virality, decreased organic reach and tried every which way of getting someone, anyone to pay more for visibility on its once-open social network. A more desperate measure was probably needed.\\n\\nThank you /u/neutralWeb.\\n\\n**Curious case of IT Ministry\\'s \"daft\" encryption policy**\\n\\nThere have been multiple posts about this in the past and one thing I thought worth pointing out was that Facebook, Whatsapp and Twitter were kept exempt from the purview of this policy. The policy has been withdrawn but it does show you in which direction the government is thinking.\\n\\nA more detailed analysis of the draft policy can be [found on Medianama](http://www.medianama.com/2015/09/223-india-draft-encryption-policy/).\\n\\n**Net Neutrality is already being violated. TRAI, IT Standing committee and IT Ministry is taking no action.**\\n\\n/u/atnixxin had [made a post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l12we/net_neutrality_in_india_status_update_sep_15th/) updating /r/india about what is happening on the NN front. From the side of the government, the tactic has been to delay it as long as possible.\\n\\nMeanwhile, phone companies have been offering Facebook and Whatsapp packs. [Illustrative example](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/33b1lv/airtels_whatsapp_pack/). I was able to see these packs till just about a fortnight ago. Now they have disappeared. I hope this is because the Government took action against them. But there have been no notifications issued from their side in this regard. Did these phone companies just take advantage of the delay, make a quick buck and exit?\\n\\nThere might be one more explanation that they were trying to prove that people actually want Zero Rating plans. In the past few months, they must have sold these plans to a lot of people and now they might use this as an argument in favor of Zero Rating in the correct forums.\\n\\n**Why I don\\'t trust Facebook: Because they do weird social experiments**\\n\\nFacebook has done [a massive psychological newsfeed experiment](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds) to \"control human emotions\". They have been working on ways which would let them influence the decisions of users by calibrating what information they consume. Imagine a scenario where they start influencing how people vote. Perhaps in the world\\'s largest democracy.\\n\\nIn such a situation, it would be vital for *any* political party to stay in the good books of Zuckerberg. Right now, it happens to be the BJP and their calculations are bang on.\\n\\n**TL;DR: My conclusion**\\n\\nThere is a concerted effort by BJP to increase its influence on the voters, as it is natural for any political entity. Social media, especially Facebook, is going to be a vehicle to spread that influence. By violating Net Neutrality and letting Facebook implement \"Freebasics\" a.k.a. Internet dot org, they will ensure that more users are added to the Social Media pool.\\n\\nThis is proven by the concerted efforts by BJP since the general elections to make Social Media as *the* source of news for people. Facebook is known for doing *mass psychological experiments* and India is a fertile ground to do more of them. Perhaps to an extent where they can influence how people vote.\\n\\nOur present government is doing all it can to make this happen.',\n",

A lot of them have \"Followed by @narendramodi\" in their profile descriptions. \\n\\nVery cleverly done.\\n\\n**Growing influence of Facebook in India**\\n\\n[Facebook has added 13 million new users from India in the past 6 months](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/facebook-user-base-has-now-climbed-to-125-million-users-in-india-272186.html) taking the number to 125 million. The social media penetration in India (as of March 2015) is close to just 10%. [source](http://www.statista.com/statistics/255235/active-social-media-penetration-in-asian-countries/). Imagine the immense amounts of users that Facebook can gain by increasing penetration in India. \\n\\nOn top of this, Facebook is worried about its value in the market. An article from way back in 2012 points out that [Facebook is a bubble that will burst](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/facebook-is-a-bubble-and-it-will-burst-210345.html). One particular quote by Mahesh Murthy is very relevant today:\\n\\n> “There isn’t much scope for growth here, really – we’re beginning to run out of connected adults on the planet,” points out venture capitalist Mahesh Murthy on his Facebook page.\\n\\nTo stay afloat, Facebook has to add more users and show the investors that they are worth investing in. Internet dot org in India serves that purpose beautifully. (If someone here can help me add more latest figures to this, it will be rather helpful)\\n\\n***\\n\\nEDIT: [See this post by Mahesh Murthy](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/internet-splinternet-facebooks-new-internetorg-just-evil-murthy) (EDIT: added the following text from the linked post)\\n\\n> Facebook has about the same number of users as Google: about 1.4 billion. That\\'s one out of five people on earth. And the social network made US$12.4 billion off them last year - that\\'s about US$ 8.65 per person on their service.\\nWhile Google made $66 billion off about the same number of people - almost $46 per head - a revenue efficiency more than 5 times that of Facebook. And that gap isn\\'t narrowing nearly fast enough.\\nRevenue growth to support Facebook\\'s stratospheric stock price at 60 times earnings is a big challenge, I\\'d imagine. Oh, and even at 5 times the revenue efficiency, Google\\'s P/E ratio is less than half of Facebook\\'s - so the pressure on the Facebook stock price can only increase with time.\\nThere\\'s only so much you can squeeze out of the first world - the current billion or so people - even though Facebook has cut virality, decreased organic reach and tried every which way of getting someone, anyone to pay more for visibility on its once-open social network. A more desperate measure was probably needed.\\n\\nThank you /u/neutralWeb.\\n\\n**Curious case of IT Ministry\\'s \"daft\" encryption policy**\\n\\nThere have been multiple posts about this in the past and one thing I thought worth pointing out was that Facebook, Whatsapp and Twitter were kept exempt from the purview of this policy. The policy has been withdrawn but it does show you in which direction the government is thinking.\\n\\nA more detailed analysis of the draft policy can be [found on Medianama](http://www.medianama.com/2015/09/223-india-draft-encryption-policy/).\\n\\n**Net Neutrality is already being violated. TRAI, IT Standing committee and IT Ministry is taking no action.**\\n\\n/u/atnixxin had [made a post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l12we/net_neutrality_in_india_status_update_sep_15th/) updating /r/india about what is happening on the NN front. From the side of the government, the tactic has been to delay it as long as possible.\\n\\nMeanwhile, phone companies have been offering Facebook and Whatsapp packs. [Illustrative example](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/33b1lv/airtels_whatsapp_pack/). I was able to see these packs till just about a fortnight ago. Now they have disappeared. I hope this is because the Government took action against them. But there have been no notifications issued from their side in this regard. Did these phone companies just take advantage of the delay, make a quick buck and exit?\\n\\nThere might be one more explanation that they were trying to prove that people actually want Zero Rating plans. In the past few months, they must have sold these plans to a lot of people and now they might use this as an argument in favor of Zero Rating in the correct forums.\\n\\n**Why I don\\'t trust Facebook: Because they do weird social experiments**\\n\\nFacebook has done [a massive psychological newsfeed experiment](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/29/facebook-users-emotions-news-feeds) to \"control human emotions\". They have been working on ways which would let them influence the decisions of users by calibrating what information they consume. Imagine a scenario where they start influencing how people vote. Perhaps in the world\\'s largest democracy.\\n\\nIn such a situation, it would be vital for *any* political party to stay in the good books of Zuckerberg. Right now, it happens to be the BJP and their calculations are bang on.\\n\\n**TL;DR: My conclusion**\\n\\nThere is a concerted effort by BJP to increase its influence on the voters, as it is natural for any political entity. Social media, especially Facebook, is going to be a vehicle to spread that influence. By violating Net Neutrality and letting Facebook implement \"Freebasics\" a.k.a. Internet dot org, they will ensure that more users are added to the Social Media pool.\\n\\nThis is proven by the concerted efforts by BJP since the general elections to make Social Media as *the* source of news for people. Facebook is known for doing *mass psychological experiments* and India is a fertile ground to do more of them. Perhaps to an extent where they can influence how people vote.\\n\\nOur present government is doing all it can to make this happen.'},\n",

I know that it is a bit of an extrapolation and they should not be generalizing like that. I have noticed that many articles that show gruesome rape events, are from Times of India. Before submitting, as responsible some  Indians, we should look at the source, make sure it is a credible source and good enough to be posted on a world platform.

I know this because I have many friends at TOI in Mumbai and I know the story.) \\n\\nThe point I am trying to make here is, we Indians, are ruining our own image outside. Many of my friends from abroad are shocked and think all of India is like that. Tourism is going to take a drastic downfall. India now is compared with Afghanistan, Pakistan etc. I know our country has problems and I am not denying that. As an Indian, who has been interacting with many foreigners, I can see that our image is going down the drain thanks to many people who are irresponsibly posting articles.\\n\\nI think we should be posting good news and bad news equally and must verify the sources before submitting. Getting some karma by posting some batshit crazy story about India which is not verified, may get you some upvotes and karma, but it is ruining the image of India elsewhere. I hope /r/India thinks about this.\\n\\nEdit: I have been to one of the biggest cities of America and europe, rape problem is as big as a problem as it is in India.

First time poster, long time lurker here.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBrief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for \"extra\" documents that weren\\'t requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!\\n\\nWe drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we\\'re nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn\\'t greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.\\n\\nHowever, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn\\'t open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy\\'s  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.\\n\\nExcuse me, what? I\\'ve never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?\\n\\nShe explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it\\'s currently 2019, there were \"crossed wires\", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn\\'t in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can\\'t have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.\\n\\nWhat is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.\\n\\nI  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in \"interaction design\", educated, and don\\'t have a criminal record.',\n",

       "  'post': 'Hey everyone, I have flaired the post AskIndia, because I am seeking a conversation about absurdities of relationships and interpersonal friendships in today\\'s world. \\n\\nWould love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...\\n\\n-------\\n\\n\"Letters To My Ex\" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.\\n\\nI think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of \"Notes From The Underground\" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.\\n\\nAnyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.\\n\\nThe original book is located here: \\n\\nhttps://www.amazon.in/Letters-My-Ex-Nikita-Singh-ebook/dp/B07938VDLS/ref=sr_1_2_twi_kin_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1535473766&sr=1-2&keywords=letters+to+my+ex\\n\\n-----------------------------\\n\\nThese are my notes:\\n\\n# On the Book\\n\\nThis books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.\\n\\nAs the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.\\n\\nShe panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. \\n\\n# January \\nThere\\'s a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.\\n\\nThen we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, \"Do you like being ignored?\"  Rolls her eyes!\\n\\nAnd then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?\\n\\n# February \\nFrom a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  \\n\\n\\nThere is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.\\n\\n\\nYes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else\\'s fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.\\n\\n# March\\n\\nThis is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.\\n\\nShe has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.\\n\\nNeedhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. \\n\\n# April\\nThe first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that \"I don\\'t know\" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.\\n\\nShe talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, \"Where do we go from here\"? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. \\n\\nAfter having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika\\'s kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.\\n\\n# May\\nMay is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.\\n\\nThen there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.\\n\\nThen there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that\\'s that. \\n\\n# June\\nThey have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.\\n\\nShe is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.\\n\\nThere is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.\\n\\n#July \\nThe one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi\\'s need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi\\'s talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!\\n\\nNeedhi\\'s friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don\\'t know how things already are!\\n\\nThen finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.\\n\\n# August\\nShe has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won\\'t. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.\\n\\nAbhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.\\n\\nShe felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.\\n\\n# September\\nShe is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.\\n\\nShe admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.\\n\\nThe one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.\\n\\n# October\\nShe finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.\\n\\nTrust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. \\n\\nEven though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.\\n\\n# November\\nAbhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.\\n\\nAbhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.\\n\\nTheir idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It\\'s not conditional, it\\'s a contract.\\n\\n# December\\nShe feels 19 again.\\n\\nThey have a set of promises one is about playing devil\\'s advocate.\\n\\nThey are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.\\n\\nThen there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that\\'s that. \\n\\n# June\\nThey have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.\\n\\nShe is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.\\n\\nThere is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.\\n\\n#July \\nThe one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi\\'s need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi\\'s talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!\\n\\nNeedhi\\'s friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don\\'t know how things already are!\\n\\nThen finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.\\n\\n# August\\nShe has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won\\'t. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.\\n\\nAbhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.\\n\\nShe felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.\\n\\n# September\\nShe is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.\\n\\nShe admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.\\n\\nThe one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.\\n\\n# October\\nShe finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.\\n\\nTrust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. \\n\\nEven though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.\\n\\n# November\\nAbhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.\\n\\nAbhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.\\n\\nTheir idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It\\'s not conditional, it\\'s a contract.\\n\\n# December\\nShe feels 19 again.\\n\\nThey have a set of promises one is about playing devil\\'s advocate.\\n\\nThey are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.\\n\\n\\n'},\n",

There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).\\n\\n#Q: How do I know what flair to use?\\n\\nA: Use common sense, for example:\\n\\n* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. \\n\\n* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. \\n\\n* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. \\n\\n* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.\\n\\n* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.\\n\\n* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. \\n\\n* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.\\n\\n\\n#Q: How do I apply the flairs?\\n\\nA: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.\\n**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png\\n\\nIf you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.\\n\\n* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]\\n* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]\\n* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]\\n* Scheduled: [Scheduled]\\n* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]\\n* Sports: [Sports], [SP]\\n* Policy: [Policy]\\n* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]\\n* Food: [Food], [FO]\\n* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]\\n\\n#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?\\n\\nA: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. \\n\\n#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?\\n\\nA: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. \\n\\nIf we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Nope!

Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.\\n**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png\\n\\nIf you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.\\n\\n* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]\\n* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]\\n* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]\\n* Scheduled: [Scheduled]\\n* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]\\n* Sports: [Sports], [SP]\\n* Policy: [Policy]\\n* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]\\n* Food: [Food], [FO]\\n* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]\\n\\n#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?\\n\\nA: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. \\n\\n#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?\\n\\nA: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. \\n\\nIf we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Nope! Read it.\"},\n",

       "  'post': \"Hi, Randians. This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.\\n*Edit: Kindly ignore the [askreddit] in the title, wanted to write ask india:)\\n\\n**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  \\nto talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party. I will give an update, irrespective of the result. Thanks to all for your suggestions, it really means a lot :)\",\n",

They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.\\n * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.\\n\\n2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP).

Leaving all the privacy concerns aside and various technical concerns aside like IPv4 to IPv6 migration (that has been covered in detail in a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/?st=jwpse9tu&sh=4ffb9a21) ), I want to delve into the more mundane or trivial shitty things that come along with Jio Giga connection  \\n\\n1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating  \\n\\n2) of course the landline connection is itself a pain in the ass. fucking takes too long between consecutive rings, one might think it even got disconnected after the first ring  \\n\\n3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  \\n\\n4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  \\n\\nenough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  \\n\\n * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  \\n * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  \\n * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  \\n\\nedit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?\"},\n",

I have been living in a non-metro city for past few years and recently shifted jobs (Company A and B) and houses (House H1 and H2) both.\\n\\n**Backstory:**\\n\\nConcerned apartment (and other unknown businesses) is/are owned by a lady \"F\", whose husband \"M\" holds an \"Irrevocable Power of Attorney\" for all things owned/operated/etc by F. Account provided to me to transfer rent every month belongs to daughter \"D\" (no idea if it is joint account). M had sent me his HUF PAN card photo before the agreement was done.\\n\\nDue to some issues, broker who showed the flat was out of picture during actual registration of agreement - which happened at sub-registrar\\'s office and not online. M was never asked to submit his individual PAN or even present F\\'s PAN.\\n\\nAll rent transfers were always online (IMPS or NEFT) from the my same account to the provided D\\'s account.\\n\\n**Actual Issue:**\\n\\nFrom April 2017 to March 2019, I have been staying at the H1. The rent was initially little less than 14k and then after 11 months, me and my owner mutually agreed to extend the agreement (over a phone call), in which he also proposed an increase in rent of rupees 1000/-. Later, in a next call few days later, he asked me to \\'pay rounded amount\\' as the rent which was exact 15k. I obliged to his terms all the times.\\n\\nNow, when in January 2018, I had asked him for PAN, he said he\\'ll talk to his lawyer and decide. Later, he declined giving it to me. Because I was not in any taxable slab, CA at company A only showed <1 lacs as rent paid and it was fine. This CA was not fine with M\\'s HUF PAN as owner\\'s PAN.\\n\\nComing to January 2019, I was confident owner would not provide PAN but still gave a call and to my surprise he said yes. He kept on prolonging actually giving it to me citing \"TDS would be cut\". I told him he\\'s a Self Employed person, so no one is going to cut TDS from him. He still never gave it. LOL. So even for FY18-19, CA at company A used 8000/- as rent paid every month as I was still out of tax slabs (submitted original agreement copy and bank statement - was never asked to submit rent receipts, and no PAN was submitted here).\\n\\nEnd on Jan, I switched jobs. Company B CA did not have a problem with HUF PAN and asked me to submit rent receipts with HUF PAN mentioned. Also, when I explained him the scenario, he asked me to address rent receipts to \"M\" instead of \"F\" as I had previously done.\\n\\nRent for H1 has been paid until March 2019, but I shifted to H2 (rent 22k) around mid March and paid equivalent rent there too. H2 has a registered agreement from March 2019 which allowed me to shift mid month because of an emergency.\\n\\n**Important Note:**\\n\\nI don\\'t care how M or F move their money around (may be in millions, has political family and is from rural west MH).\\nAll I care is saving my money and not paying his taxes - now that I am taxable. And not legally implicated.\\n\\n**Questions:**\\n\\n1. Whose PAN should actually have been provided/asked by me during registration of agreement?\\n2.

Whenever such a question is asked on randia, the answers are always the same old stuff: become a freelance developer, freelance writer or something which mostly involves internet. I think since most of randia consists of techies, they have this inherent bias towards these gigs and they are not even aware of other opportunities.\\n\\nFor example, one of my friends, 20, who goes to college full time, makes serious bank by being a club promoter. Another one, 19, makes around 15k a month by flipping the stuff he bought in airport customs auctions. \\n\\nEvidently, there's plenty of money to go around if you know where to look for it. What are some of such untapped opportunities you might know of? \"},\n",

       "  'post': \"Here is the original link of the article\\n\\nhttps://gurcharandas.org/rich-nation-poor\\n\\nIndia: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again\\n\\nEssays\\xa0| March 19, 2007 - 12:38\\n\\n(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)\\n\\nDoes 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?\\n\\nConsider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.\\n\\nAs a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!\\n\\nHow does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2\\xa0The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.\\n\\nAlthough the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3\\n\\nThis changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4\\xa0Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5\\n\\nBut economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.\\n\\nI believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7\\n\\nI shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?\\n\\nLet's begin with the Mughals\\n\\nIndia's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8\\xa0During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9\\xa0India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10\\n\\nIn 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11\\n\\nIt took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12\\xa0What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.\\n\\nIndia was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century\\n\\nIndia was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13\\xa0It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?\\n\\nDespite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14\\xa0and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15\\n\\nThere is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16\\xa0There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”\\n\\nDid the British Raj impoverish India?\\n\\nIndia's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.\\n\\nNationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17\\n\\nBritain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18\\n\\nIn recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19\\n\\nThey also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20\\xa0If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.\\n\\nIndia begins to re-industrize\\n\\nIndian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.”\\xa022\\xa0The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.\\n\\nBy Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).\\n\\nWhy didn't an industrial revolution occur?\\n\\nOne of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.\\n\\nAmiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24\\xa0If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25\\xa0An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26\\xa0But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.\\n\\nUnlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.\\n\\nWhat is the verdict on British rule?\\n\\nDid the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.\\n\\nOdd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27\\xa0Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28\\n\\nAlthough Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.\\n\\nIndependence and 'License Raj'\\n\\nAfter Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?\\n\\nI think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.\\n\\nNehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.\\n\\nEven more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.\\n\\nLarge business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29\\n\\nThe system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.\\n\\nAlthough it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30\\n\\n“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32\\xa0It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.\\n\\nIndia after the Reforms\\n\\nAlthough there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33\\n\\nIndians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.\\n\\nThere has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.\\n\\nThe world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.\\n\\nSome lessons\\n\\nNeoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.\\n\\nBut this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.\\n\\nAfter Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.\\n\\nIndia embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.\\n\\nIndia's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.\\n\\nSince politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.\\n\\nBut India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.\\n\\nWill capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.\\n\\nThe curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.\\n\\nDoes culture matter?\\n\\nCultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34\\n\\nDeepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35\\xa0David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36\\n\\nWhile institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.\\n\\nThus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37\\xa0It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.\\n\\nWhen seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.\\n\\nI find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.\\n\\nOur continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.\\n\\n\\n\",\n",

After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as “the Hindu rate of growth.” Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.\\n\\nAs a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!\\n\\nHow does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2\\xa0The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.\\n\\nAlthough the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a “golden age” driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3\\n\\nThis changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4\\xa0Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. “Collective learning” is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5\\n\\nBut economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals—all these were market friendly moves, after all.\\n\\nI believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds—it created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7\\n\\nI shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?\\n\\nLet's begin with the Mughals\\n\\nIndia's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8\\xa0During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9\\xa0India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10\\n\\nIn 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and “mines of gold.” He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11\\n\\nIt took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12\\xa0What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.\\n\\nIndia was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century\\n\\nIndia was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13\\xa0It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?\\n\\nDespite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,”14\\xa0and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a “per capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.”15\\n\\nThere is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”16\\xa0There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, “In India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.”\\n\\nDid the British Raj impoverish India?\\n\\nIndia's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and “deindustrialized” India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.\\n\\nNationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule “de-industrialised” India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17\\n\\nBritain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18\\n\\nIn recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19\\n\\nThey also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant—by 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a “drain of wealth”, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment—the so called “home charges”—was in fact quite small.20\\xa0If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.\\n\\nIndia begins to re-industrize\\n\\nIndian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.”\\xa022\\xa0The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.\\n\\nBy Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).\\n\\nWhy didn't an industrial revolution occur?\\n\\nOne of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence—and after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.\\n\\nAmiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24\\xa0If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25\\xa0An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital—all of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26\\xa0But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.\\n\\nUnlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.\\n\\nWhat is the verdict on British rule?\\n\\nDid the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.\\n\\nOdd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not “exploit” India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27\\xa0Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses—hence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28\\n\\nAlthough Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace—the Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.\\n\\nIndependence and 'License Raj'\\n\\nAfter Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.\\n\\nJawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution—an agricultural surplus—but the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?\\n\\nI think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.\\n\\nNehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.\\n\\nEven more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.\\n\\nLarge business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29\\n\\nThe system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.\\n\\nAlthough it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30\\n\\n“1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.”31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32\\xa0It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into “License Raj”.\\n\\nIndia after the Reforms\\n\\nAlthough there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33\\n\\nIndians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.\\n\\nThere has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.\\n\\nThe world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These “Bangalores” have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.\\n\\nSome lessons\\n\\nNeoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a “golden period” in world trade between 1950 and 1970; “License Raj” and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.\\n\\nBut this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.\\n\\nAfter Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.\\n\\nIndia embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.\\n\\nIndia's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of “welfare” before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism—or rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.\\n\\nSince politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.\\n\\nBut India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.\\n\\nWill capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.\\n\\nThe curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These “million negotiations of democracy” slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.\\n\\nDoes culture matter?\\n\\nCultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its “low level equilibrium” of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34\\n\\nDeepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level “Hindu equilibrium” around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35\\xa0David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36\\n\\nWhile institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no “Hindu equilibrium” to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.\\n\\nThus, I am uncomfortable with the “otherworldly values of the Hindus” or the “immobilizing effects of the caste system” and the “conservative habits of the merchant caste”. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that “people would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.”37\\xa0It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.\\n\\nWhen seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.\\n\\nI find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs—it has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.\\n\\nOur continuing inability to distinguish between the “modern” and the “western” in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (“remove English from primary schools”). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.\\n\\n\\n\"},\n",

There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).\\n\\n#Q: How do I know what flair to use?\\n\\nA: Use common sense, for example:\\n\\n* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. \\n\\n* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. \\n\\n* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. \\n\\n* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.\\n\\n* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.\\n\\n* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. \\n\\n* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.\\n\\n\\n#Q: How do I apply the flairs?\\n\\nA: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.\\n**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png\\n\\nIf you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.\\n\\n* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]\\n* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]\\n* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]\\n* Scheduled: [Scheduled]\\n* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]\\n* Sports: [Sports], [SP]\\n* Policy: [Policy]\\n* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]\\n* Food: [Food], [FO]\\n* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]\\n\\n#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?\\n\\nA: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. \\n\\n#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?\\n\\nA: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. \\n\\nIf we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Nope!

We\\'ve all had our days when we recoil, aghast, from the cesspool of comments on a particular thread.\\n\\nNevertheless, the cloud has a silver lining. Older users will agree that things have improved significantly since the days of the multiple -ki-baap, -ki-maa, and _spokesperson accounts. How can we nurture and sustain this delicate green shoot of civil discussion? Here are some guidelines, adapted from [reddit\\'s ettiquette guide.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)\\n\\n###1. The downvote is not a \"dislike\" button\\nPlease do not downvote a post or a comment only because you think it\\'s wrong, or you\\'re not interested in it. \\n\\nDownvote **posts** if you think these kinds of posts do not belong on /r/india, or if you\\'ve seen the same content being posted multiple times before. Multiple posts of a single breaking news events, million photographs of \"farmers\", and links to FB flamewars are good examples of posts which I would downvote. \\n\\nDownvote **comments** if you think it is harmful to the discussion. Rude attacks on other users, paranoid conspiracy theories, and _some_ trolls are examples of comments I would downvote. I don\\'t like Modi, but many times I have upvoted comments which support him because many people have different opinions, and I respect that. \\n\\n###2. Redditors are real people too!\\nThis is an anonymous internet forum, and it\\'s easy to temporarily forget that the user you\\'re speaking to is a real person, with family and a life and her own problems, likes and dislikes. So before you call someone an idiot, retard, chaddi, Congie, etc., please think: would you do this to a real person in your life? What makes you think it\\'s okay to do that to people on reddit? \\n\\n###3. /r/india is mainly what users make it\\nA subreddit is mainly determined by what its users do. If you want more self posts, submit more, and upvote them when you see them. If you want less politics, ~~downvote~~ IGNORE politics posts, and submit and upvote more non-political content.     \\nIf you are not okay with insults and rudeness, then leave a _polite_ reminder asking people to be more civil. Downvote only the worst comments.\\n\\n----\\n\\ntl;dr: The next time you feel an urge to downvote someone politely saying something about Modi, Sachin, rape, SRK, or how your hometown sucks, please DON\\'T. Even worse, don\\'t insult them for their opinion. _Explain_ why you disagree, instead.  \\nDon\\'t _only_ complain about content, please contribute content you would like to see. ',\n",

How can we nurture and sustain this delicate green shoot of civil discussion? Here are some guidelines, adapted from [reddit\\'s ettiquette guide.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)\\n\\n###1. The downvote is not a \"dislike\" button\\nPlease do not downvote a post or a comment only because you think it\\'s wrong, or you\\'re not interested in it. \\n\\nDownvote **posts** if you think these kinds of posts do not belong on /r/india, or if you\\'ve seen the same content being posted multiple times before. Multiple posts of a single breaking news events, million photographs of \"farmers\", and links to FB flamewars are good examples of posts which I would downvote. \\n\\nDownvote **comments** if you think it is harmful to the discussion. Rude attacks on other users, paranoid conspiracy theories, and _some_ trolls are examples of comments I would downvote. I don\\'t like Modi, but many times I have upvoted comments which support him because many people have different opinions, and I respect that. \\n\\n###2. Redditors are real people too!\\nThis is an anonymous internet forum, and it\\'s easy to temporarily forget that the user you\\'re speaking to is a real person, with family and a life and her own problems, likes and dislikes. So before you call someone an idiot, retard, chaddi, Congie, etc., please think: would you do this to a real person in your life? What makes you think it\\'s okay to do that to people on reddit? \\n\\n###3. /r/india is mainly what users make it\\nA subreddit is mainly determined by what its users do. If you want more self posts, submit more, and upvote them when you see them. If you want less politics, ~~downvote~~ IGNORE politics posts, and submit and upvote more non-political content.     \\nIf you are not okay with insults and rudeness, then leave a _polite_ reminder asking people to be more civil. Downvote only the worst comments.\\n\\n----\\n\\ntl;dr: The next time you feel an urge to downvote someone politely saying something about Modi, Sachin, rape, SRK, or how your hometown sucks, please DON\\'T. Even worse, don\\'t insult them for their opinion. _Explain_ why you disagree, instead.  \\nDon\\'t _only_ complain about content, please contribute content you would like to see. '},\n",

Over the past week we realized that there is a major communication gap between the users and certain moderation initiatives we have under taken. To be precise I am talking about the ‘comment score hiding’ feature test initiated by mod /u/rahulthewall 2 days ago. The feature was introduced to the mods by reddit admins a couple of months ago and since then a lot of communities have tested and implemented it successfully.

If set, comments in the subreddit will have their score hidden for the specified number of minutes, after which the score will appear as normal. For example, if set to \"60\", any comments less than an hour old will not show their score. Voting still behaves normally, and behavior of the page will not otherwise be affected (best/top sorting will still use the scores, comments with score less than the user\\'s threshold will be collapsed, etc.), but the comment\\'s actual score will not be visible until it is at least that many minutes old.

By hiding the score for a while after posting, the bias of seeing how other people voted on the comment should be greatly reduced.\\n\\nSome other notes about how this feature works:\\n - The maximum for the setting is 1440 minutes (24 hours). \\n- Scores will remain visible to moderators (and admins). \\n- Scores will also be hidden for RES users, mobile users, etc. (will display as the comment having the default 1 point in mobile clients)\\n\\n* /r/india on Comment score hiding: [2 DAY OLD POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1jjx0b/to_the_mods_of_rindia_about_hidden_scores/) | [3 MONTH OLD POST](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/1dew7v/moderators_new_subreddit_feature_comment_scores/)\\n\\n• **General Reddit Feedback**: The community opinion is largely divided about this feature, but many subs have found it extremely useful.

We have grown from a small community of 3000 subs to close to 6000 subs within 8 months. \\n\\nReddit as a community has contributed to many positive changes in the US. Look at what kleinbl00 did for youngluck, or look at communities like r/favors, r/assistance, r/randomactsofpizza and their likes. \\n\\nI'm not asking or even suggesting that r/india to do something on that level. All I'm asking for is civility in discussions and to users to stop abusing each other. \\n\\nFrom a community that was robust in its discussions, we have devolved into a community of name calling, hatred, trolling and religious hatred. Debates are healthy and enrich the knowledge of everyone involved if done in the right manner. But here the only response seems to insulting each other and their family members\\n\\nThe experiment of banning users was something that I myself was not convinced on.

       "  'all': \"A Humble Request. This is a humble plea to all my fellow redditors in r/india and to whoever is trolling us in the name of maula and his sock-puppets.\\n\\nThe forum has gone through so many changes in the last year. We have grown from a small community of 3000 subs to close to 6000 subs within 8 months. \\n\\nReddit as a community has contributed to many positive changes in the US. Look at what kleinbl00 did for youngluck, or look at communities like r/favors, r/assistance, r/randomactsofpizza and their likes. \\n\\nI'm not asking or even suggesting that r/india to do something on that level. All I'm asking for is civility in discussions and to users to stop abusing each other. \\n\\nFrom a community that was robust in its discussions, we have devolved into a community of name calling, hatred, trolling and religious hatred. Debates are healthy and enrich the knowledge of everyone involved if done in the right manner. But here the only response seems to insulting each other and their family members\\n\\nThe experiment of banning users was something that I myself was not convinced on.

Plus, I am shocked that this incident wasn't posted here by anybody while right wingers are bashing him calling him a 'leech' and 'trying to divide India'.\\n\\nI am a Bengali. No, I ain't 'proud' of my culture. I don't believe you can be proud of something you got just by being born. Nor do I think Bengalis or Bengali culture is somewhat superior to other cultures. But here is the thing - 'Jai Shri Ram' isn't our culture. 'Jai Ma Durga/Kali' is.\\n\\nI have observed that BJP/right-wingers have a belief that only their (central/North Indian) version of Hinduism is the only Hinduism. They completely ignore Eastern and Southern versions of it. They have trouble understanding the fact that Hinduism is an umbrella term for ALL religions in pre-British era India. Their obsession with Ram Mandir is a proof of it. From my experience, Hindus of South India and Eastern India have almost no interest in a Ram Mandir. Bengali Hindus mostly follow and believe in Shaktism, in Durga/Kali and our culture has been mainly influenced by Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Sarada trio. And we have our temple - the Dakshineshwar temple. Odisha has Jaganath temple, a large temple, visited by millions of people around India. In South India, they have Tirumala, another huge temple with millions of devotees. Then you have Sabarimala, in the North you have the famous Amarnath temple, which attract a lot of pilgrims. Every part of India have their own favourite 'god'. In Hinduism, it says God is one but is worshiped in different forms by different rituals. Everyone has their own versions and they are devoted to them. I would argue, not a lot of Hindus are really into Ram to be honest. Of course, all Hindus respect Ram and believe he is an avatar, but not that important as a deity to worship.\\n\\nNow, don't get me wrong, there are a lot of Marwaris, Biharis, etc here in Bengal and a lot of them say 'Jai Shri Ram'. Bengalis do respect their beliefs and often say 'Yeah, jai shri Ram' in response. But that's it. Anyone will devote themselves more to Kali/Durga rather than Ram here in Bengal.\\n\\nIt will sound really rude and discriminatory but I will say this very clearly - Hindi-speakers are that much foreign to many conservative Bengalis as are, say, Rohingyas to Indians. Why? Language barrier. We do not speak the same language. Hindi and its accent is difficult to imitate for many Bengalis. Our cultures are different. Many of our cuisines are different. Our ceremonies are different. Our attires are often different. A 'royal and rich' Marwari house is very different from a 'bonedi rich' Bengali house. I have heard numerous people, including my relatives, complain how non-Bengalis are taking over Bengal and we need to stop it (yeah, I know it is kind of discriminatory but I have heard this a lot). I mean heck, even our classic slangs are different.\\n\\nBJP is hell bent on imposing Hindi and 'Jai Shri Ram' on the face of all Hindus. But that is just not the reality. Many Hindus don't (and don't want to) speak Hindi or pray to Ram or are interested in what happens in Ayodhya. The entrance of BJP in West Bengal has been more or less the same way TMC came into power - being out of options. CPM was a terrible choice for Bengal and the only option then was TMC. So, they rose to power. Now that BJP is in power and TMC and CPM both are terrible (Congress has been an unpopular choice), BJP is the only option. Plus, many of the BJP's members, like Locket Chatterjee, are very active here and does a lot of work for the people. But I don't think people of Bengal are really interested in this whole 'Hindutva/Hindi/Ram' thing.\\n\\nA tip for BJP: If you want a good entrance here in Bengal you have to say 'Jai Ma' and 'Suorer baccha' first.\",\n",

       "  'all': \"In my opinion, Amartya Sen is right about 'Jai Shri Ram' not being a Bengali culture. Sorry for posting about this so late. Wanted to, but had exams. Plus, I am shocked that this incident wasn't posted here by anybody while right wingers are bashing him calling him a 'leech' and 'trying to divide India'.\\n\\nI am a Bengali. No, I ain't 'proud' of my culture. I don't believe you can be proud of something you got just by being born. Nor do I think Bengalis or Bengali culture is somewhat superior to other cultures. But here is the thing - 'Jai Shri Ram' isn't our culture. 'Jai Ma Durga/Kali' is.\\n\\nI have observed that BJP/right-wingers have a belief that only their (central/North Indian) version of Hinduism is the only Hinduism. They completely ignore Eastern and Southern versions of it. They have trouble understanding the fact that Hinduism is an umbrella term for ALL religions in pre-British era India. Their obsession with Ram Mandir is a proof of it. From my experience, Hindus of South India and Eastern India have almost no interest in a Ram Mandir. Bengali Hindus mostly follow and believe in Shaktism, in Durga/Kali and our culture has been mainly influenced by Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Sarada trio. And we have our temple - the Dakshineshwar temple. Odisha has Jaganath temple, a large temple, visited by millions of people around India. In South India, they have Tirumala, another huge temple with millions of devotees. Then you have Sabarimala, in the North you have the famous Amarnath temple, which attract a lot of pilgrims.

We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.\\n\\nThe principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.\\n\\n**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.\\n\\nWe believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:\\n\\n1. The primacy of fundamental human rights\\n2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.\\n\\n**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**\\n\\nThis is a 50-year project.\\n\\nThe RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country’s politics.\\n\\nOur goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.\\n\\n**Metrics driven**\\n\\nWe will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:\\n\\n1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)\\n2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)\\n3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)\\n4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)\\n5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)\\n6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)\\n7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)\\n8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)\\n9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)\\n10. Gender equality report (87/144)\\n\\nWe will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.\\n\\n**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**\\n\\nCapitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.\\n\\n**We are committed to internal democracy**\\n\\nAs a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.\\n\\n**National security**\\n\\nWe will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don’t believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.\\n\\n**Caste and reservations**\\n\\nWe absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don’t apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.\\n\\nOver 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.\\n\\nOur approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.\\n\\n**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**\\n\\nWe believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.\\n\\nIndividuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.\\n\\n**Science and business**\\n\\nWe will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We’re fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.\\n\\n**Join us or improve us**\\n\\nIf this is a vision that appeals to you, please become a member.

Like most of this country's youth, I had done my B.E in Computer Science and Engineering although the problem is, well around my third year in this program did I realize that I was never cut out for this program, or for pursuing Engineering for that matter. I was never coaxed by my parents in doing this degree, I kinda like Computers, I am okay with Science too, it's just.... CSE was not what I thought it would be. Or at least, programming kinda put me off and I don't think I have what it takes to become a mediocre programmer let alone be a good one.\\n\\nLooking back in my school days, I realized that I always used to score good marks in Humanities (like Social Studies and personally love it too), was okay/average in Science(be it Biology or Physical Science) and sucked big time at Mathematics, although this may mean nothing considering, it may not be much of a big deal to obtain good marks or a good rank in school. Math has always been that subject that has brought down my marks and personally, I also tend to have bad memories and experience with that subject and thus not only am I bad at it, I also hate it with an immense passion (No offense to any Math wizards and enthusiasts out there and forgive me if I sounded rude by making that statement). I know hating on engineering (Unlike Mathematics, I don't necessarily hate Engineering though, just bad at it and lacking the temperament required) is the 'in and hip thing' to do right now with all those short films and YouTube videos from popular channels deconstructing the notion of the 'Engineering Dream' this nation is obsessed with and thus, by no means am I implying that I am a special snowflake or unique by not being interested in it. \\n\\nBut what I wish to know is, do I really not have a choice? Is it too late to do the things I am interested in or the ones I personally feel I am good at? Am I supposed to become an IT professional and live my life doing and probably phoning it in with something I am not good at? If that's the case, then I don't mind pulling off an appropriate resolution and will thus, try to learn the necessary skills and tools required to become one, at least in the short run.\\n\\nBut if that is not the case, what options do I have? Shall I venture into freelancing and do English related works like Article/Content Writing or if I have what it takes, become a storyteller (Please, do kindly share your thoughts about my written English skills, from what you are able to observe from this post, if you feel like doing so and feel free to criticize and lend me some advice if you had found my skills to be shoddy and of sub par quality).\\n\\nAlong with this lack of direction and a feeling of uncertainty in my life, I am also feeling very lonely right now, with all my batch-mates having moved on with their lives (rather quickly too, I must say), with some of my friends not even bothering to share with me the good news of them recently getting a job somewhere. I mean this feeling of intense loneliness is probably the reason why I decided to create an account on this site and participate in certain communities, engage in them so as I might learn something meaningful and of insight, and share my thoughts (and if I am able to, contribute something from my side by sharing my pool of knowledge and whatever wisdom I possess, if in need).\\n\\nI am certain that many of you here in this sub reddit might have certainly experienced the things I have mentioned and undergone above and thus, I humbly ask your valuable insight and experience from your part if you don't mind sharing them with me.\\n\\nMy sincere thanks and apologies if this post was too long and such a drag.\\n\\n(PS- My apologies if i had tagged the wrong flair for this post. 'Non-political' tag is appropriate right?).\",\n",

I was never coaxed by my parents in doing this degree, I kinda like Computers, I am okay with Science too, it's just.... CSE was not what I thought it would be. Or at least, programming kinda put me off and I don't think I have what it takes to become a mediocre programmer let alone be a good one.\\n\\nLooking back in my school days, I realized that I always used to score good marks in Humanities (like Social Studies and personally love it too), was okay/average in Science(be it Biology or Physical Science) and sucked big time at Mathematics, although this may mean nothing considering, it may not be much of a big deal to obtain good marks or a good rank in school. Math has always been that subject that has brought down my marks and personally, I also tend to have bad memories and experience with that subject and thus not only am I bad at it, I also hate it with an immense passion (No offense to any Math wizards and enthusiasts out there and forgive me if I sounded rude by making that statement). I know hating on engineering (Unlike Mathematics, I don't necessarily hate Engineering though, just bad at it and lacking the temperament required) is the 'in and hip thing' to do right now with all those short films and YouTube videos from popular channels deconstructing the notion of the 'Engineering Dream' this nation is obsessed with and thus, by no means am I implying that I am a special snowflake or unique by not being interested in it. \\n\\nBut what I wish to know is, do I really not have a choice? Is it too late to do the things I am interested in or the ones I personally feel I am good at? Am I supposed to become an IT professional and live my life doing and probably phoning it in with something I am not good at? If that's the case, then I don't mind pulling off an appropriate resolution and will thus, try to learn the necessary skills and tools required to become one, at least in the short run.\\n\\nBut if that is not the case, what options do I have? Shall I venture into freelancing and do English related works like Article/Content Writing or if I have what it takes, become a storyteller (Please, do kindly share your thoughts about my written English skills, from what you are able to observe from this post, if you feel like doing so and feel free to criticize and lend me some advice if you had found my skills to be shoddy and of sub par quality).\\n\\nAlong with this lack of direction and a feeling of uncertainty in my life, I am also feeling very lonely right now, with all my batch-mates having moved on with their lives (rather quickly too, I must say), with some of my friends not even bothering to share with me the good news of them recently getting a job somewhere. I mean this feeling of intense loneliness is probably the reason why I decided to create an account on this site and participate in certain communities, engage in them so as I might learn something meaningful and of insight, and share my thoughts (and if I am able to, contribute something from my side by sharing my pool of knowledge and whatever wisdom I possess, if in need).\\n\\nI am certain that many of you here in this sub reddit might have certainly experienced the things I have mentioned and undergone above and thus, I humbly ask your valuable insight and experience from your part if you don't mind sharing them with me.\\n\\nMy sincere thanks and apologies if this post was too long and such a drag.\\n\\n(PS- My apologies if i had tagged the wrong flair for this post. 'Non-political' tag is appropriate right?).\"},\n",

Meanwhile, those who are against state flairs, you can \\n\\n1. choose not to flair yourselves.\\n2. choose a flair like `India` or `Earth` or `Universe` \\n\\nWe will keep this thing alive for some more time to allow more users to see this post. We will monitor the feedback and if the overall consensus is against state flairs then we shall disable state flairs.\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Edit 3:**\\n\\nHere are some of the status messages we have to deal with on custom flairs\\n\\n* Hate speech\\n* Sub promotions\\n* User targets and witch hunts\\n\\nReddit does not allow automated flair checks which means we have to reply on manual inspections which is definitely time consuming. In a lot of cases, we catch this very very late and a lot of damage has been done. So, custom flairs are out of the question. '},\n",

There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).\\n\\n#Q: How do I know what flair to use?\\n\\nA: Use common sense, for example:\\n\\n* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. \\n\\n* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. \\n\\n* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. \\n\\n* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.\\n\\n* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.\\n\\n* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. \\n\\n* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.\\n\\n\\n#Q: How do I apply the flairs?\\n\\nA: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.\\n**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png\\n\\nIf you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.\\n\\n* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]\\n* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]\\n* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]\\n* Scheduled: [Scheduled]\\n* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]\\n* Sports: [Sports], [SP]\\n* Policy: [Policy]\\n* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]\\n* Food: [Food], [FO]\\n* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]\\n\\n#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?\\n\\nA: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. \\n\\n#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?\\n\\nA: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. \\n\\nIf we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTLDR: Nope!

They are demanding to know why did I waste so much of their hard earned money on tuition. They are scared about my future in Journalism, if I take it up.

The story about the economy doing well is a fake story like everything else told to you by Narendra Modi.\\n\\n\\n**What triggered this take over bid of RBI Reserves?**\\n\\nBecause many companies were declaring NPA\\'s and the biggest shock came when IL&FS declared (officially) an NPA of 90,000 Crores. And none of the directors was arrested.\\n\\n\\n**But why take over RBI Reserves when it had already paid a dividend of 58,000 Crores for the last fiscal?**\\n\\nBecause that was not enough to fill the holes created by businessmen who lost money hand over fist.\\n\\n\\n**What will be the consequences for ordinary people when government prints more money?**\\n\\nPrices will rise across the board as more money will be chasing the same basket of goods and services.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Why Does Government of India require so much money and needs to print more?**\\n\\nIt is because GST has failed. From the expected collection of 1,30,000 Crores per month, it is only collecting 90,000 to 1,00,000 Crores with 30,000 Crores going back as refunds. Every month there has been a deficit of 30,000 Crores on an average.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Why GST Collection has fallen?**\\n\\nBecause it has been declared by IMF as the most complex form of taxation in the world and Indian businessmen have been smart to find out ways to avoid it, also the business volume has fallen as economy has failed.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Why Business Volume has fallen?**\\n\\nIf you withdraw 83% of blood of an economy for 2 months and then take 6 months to pump back that blood, you can\\'t expect the person to get up and start running as if nothing had happened. Demonetization was such a blunder. It killed the economy and India lost 2% of GDP, which is approximately 3,00,000 Crores. And the losses continue. But Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar have both certified Demonetization as a brilliant move and they have also been endorsed by the likes of Aishwarya Rai and Paresh Rawal.\\n\\n\\n\\n**What is the immediate danger?**\\n\\nTelecom sector, that has seen mergers is now three players, Airtel, Vodafone Idea Limited and Jio and all three are bleeding. Telecom sector is sitting on 8,00,000 Crore possible NPA as estimated by SBI internal report which was later suppressed.\\n\\n\\n**What about the GDP figures that show NDA-2 doing better than UPA-2?**\\n\\nFormer CEA has already spoken on this and informed how the Niti Aayog changed the figures and how to make NDA-2 look better they made UPA-2 look bad. They just drew a bigger line next to the UPA-2 Line.\\n\\n\\n\\n**Who is responsible for all this mess?**\\nOf course Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru is responsible for all this mess and his family. They have not allowed Narendra Modi to do anything in the last 56 months.

He is the savior of Hindus. He is the only person on the face of earth who can teach Muslims a lesson. He is the only person in India who can protect the cow. He is the only person in India who takes \\'care\\' of the poor, marginal, soldiers and veterans. He is the only person in India who can build the Ram Mandir. He is the only person on earth who has left behind his wife and family and even his mother and the only person who himself lives on 10 acres of prime property, protected by 5 layers of security while his 90+ year old mother stands in bank queues to withdraw 4000 Rupees as per demonetization rules along with a camera crew. Because he is the only PM who has traveled the world and done so many town-hall and rock-star type shows. Because he does Mann-Ki-Baat every month on Radio and it is broadcast on TV too.

This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.\\n * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.\\n\\n2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica — all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP).
